The estimated potential capacity of each city in the country is derived from official data and acceptable assumptions and is subject to discussion and evaluation in the context of a viable hydrogen economy. According to the findings, the potential for green hydrogen generation in Turkiye is projected to be 7.33 million tons using a proton exchange membrane electrolyser (PEMEL). Cities with the highest hydrogen production capacities from marine applications are Mugla, Izmir, Antalya, and Canakkale with 998.10 kt, 840.31 kt, 605.46 kt, and 550.42 kt, respectively. The study calculations obviously show that there is a great potential by using excess power in producing hydrogen which will result in an economic value of 3.83 billion US dollars. This study further helps develop a detailed hydrogen map for every city in Turkiye, using the identified potential capacities of renewable energy sources and the utilization of electrolysers to make green hydrogen by green power. The potentials and specific capacities for every city are also highlighted. Furthermore, the study results are expected to provide clear guidance for government authorities and industries to utilize such a potential of renewable energy for investment and promote clean energy projects by further addressing concerns caused by the usage of carbon-based (fossil fuels dependent) energy options. Moreover, green hydrogen production and utilization in every sector will help achieve the national targets for a net zero economy and cope with international targets to achieve the United Nation's sustainable development goals.",Cost | Economy | Electrolyser | Environment | Green hydrogen | Sustainable development | Tidal energy | Undersea current energy | Wave energy,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

One promising technological solution is rooftop-mounted turbines into buildings. This study presents an evaluation of the potential for wind energy utilization on the rooftop of a 29 m tall building. The primary objective of this research is to develop a methodology that can effectively investigate the integration of small wind turbines (SWTs) into urban buildings, intending to promote energy sufficiency in urban areas. A robust framework has been developed that consists of seven steps. These steps include site selection, evaluating urban wind energy with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and on-site measurements, selecting an appropriate SWT, estimating the annual energy production (AEP), conducting an evaluation of the environmental impact, resilience, and economic analysis, and finally, installing the system. This straightforward yet reliable framework provides a comprehensive approach to assessing the viability of wind energy utilization in urban areas. The findings revealed that the most suitable location for installation had an estimated AEP of around 1030 kWh, leading to a reduction in emissions of 0.64 tCO2/y. Additionally, it was observed that the building's geometry and orientation significantly affected the wind flow, causing a substantial decrease in wind speed downstream.

Reduced air pollution is only one of the many economic and environmental advantages of clean energy. An effective contractor with experience and knowledge in clean energy projects is always required to handle the complicated process of planning, implementing, and maintaining the new clean energy infrastructure. Contractor selection for renewable energy projects (REPs) is a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. Linguistic T-spherical fuzzy set (LT-SFS) can be compatible with fuzzier information, and the contractor selection problem also has a lot of fuzzy information, which makes LT-SFS very suitable for contractor selection for REPs. Hence, the present work proposes a MAGDM methodology utilizing a combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) method within the LT-SF context. For that, the Einstein and Frank t-norm and t-conorm has been used to define new and generalized operational laws for linguistic T-spherical fuzzy numbers. Then, the linguistic T-spherical fuzzy Einstein and linguistic T-spherical fuzzy Frank aggregation operators are proposed to integrate the information data provided by experts. Moreover, the proposed aggregation operators based-CODAS approach is designed to evaluate and rank the available alternatives. A real-life decision problem of selecting the best suitable contractor for a renewable energy project is solved to verify our suggested technique. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is also carried out by changing the parameter's value to check the consistency of the rank order. Finally, the new model is compared with existing approaches to demonstrate its strength. The comparative analysis shows that the results of the suggested technique are more feasible and beneficial than those of existing approaches.",Aggregation operators | Clean energy | Combinative distance-based assessment method | Linguistic T-spherical fuzzy set | Multi-attribute group decision-making,0,0,,,KSU,24ZJQN114Y,King Saud University

The overall results demonstrate that the higher the heating capacity of a GHPS, the greater the environmental impact. Such results allow us to establish correlations between GHPS heating capacity and environmental impact across the 11 environmental impact categories. Amortization periods were calculated with respect to the annual demand for heating and cooling of each facility. In the 10 kW and 15 kW GHPS, the amortization period is shorter than 11 years, followed by an eight-year period for the 45 kW GHPS.

The purpose of this study is to develop methodological approach to the evaluation of biogas energy projects using integrated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission metrics. The indicator for the environmental efficiency assessment of an investment project with partial replacement of power consumption from the grid in terms of GHG emissions was proposed and tested on the regional energy facilities. The developed indicator considerably complements existing approaches to the efficiency assessment of biogas projects and allows to evaluate the performance of biogas projects using a single indicator that significantly simplifies the assessment procedure. It could also be paired with economic indicators such as net profit value, total capital costs in order to build a dependency matrix diagram for environmental and economic assessment of the projects. The proposed methodology could be especially useful for biogas projects implemented in countries and territories with large reserves of fossil fuels, when the profitability and economic efficiency of renewable energy projects are low.",Biofuels | Biogas projects | Environmental and economic assessment | GHG emissions,1,0,,,RSF,22-28-01740,Russian Science Foundation

The study employed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate various energy, economic, and environmental indicators for potential wind farm installations at multiple suitable locations across Libya. The assessment encompassed estimations of energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the conversion of wind energy into electricity throughout the entire life cycle of the proposed wind farms. In light of Libya not being a producer of wind energy converters, a novel approach was developed to define the system's boundaries. These boundaries included distinct subsystems, each corresponding to various stages within the life cycle of a wind energy system, encompassing factors such as shipping emissions from the manufacturer's location to Tripoli's marine ports, land transportation to the wind farm sites, energy and emissions associated with installation, operation, maintenance, and eventual disposal of wind turbines. Hourly climate data spanning a 25-year period from 1995 to 2020 were gathered from the SolarGis climate information site. The System Advisor Model (SAM) program was utilized to predict the energy yields of 100 MW capacity wind farms at 12 sites in Libya. Additionally, a novel eco-environmental indicator known as the Life Cycle Levelized Cost of Energy (LCLCOE) was introduced, which factors in all environmental damage costs throughout the entire lifespan of wind energy projects. The study's findings revealed that the Gamesa turbine, with a capital cost of $146,916,400 for a 100 MW capacity wind energy farm, exhibited the most favorable economic and environmental performance. GHG emission factors across all examined cities ranged from 32 to 70 gGHG/kWh, with carbon payback durations spanning from 4.5 to 12.3 months. The estimated energy payback period varied from 13 to 22 months, while the LCLCOE ranged from 4.8 to 8.4 ¢/kWh.",Environmental impact assessment | Greenhouse gas emission factor | Libya | Life cycle analysis | Life cycle levelized cost of energy | Wind energy,13,0,,,,undefined,

As a country with rich marine resources, Portugal’s marine environment is of great significance to the development of marine energy. However, the current impact assessment of marine renewable energy projects has shortcomings such as incomplete understanding of ecosystems, incomplete consideration of fishery resources and socioeconomic impacts, lack of accuracy, and failure to consider geographical differences, thus lacking comprehensiveness and accuracy. To this end, we propose the ACO-TCN-Attention model to address these shortcomings in current impact assessments of marine renewable energy projects. The goal of this model is to provide a more comprehensive, precise and nuanced analysis to better understand the impacts of these projects on ecosystems, socio-economics and local communities. “ACO-TCN-Attention” is a model architecture that combines multiple machine learning and deep learning concepts. It includes three main parts: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Attention mechanism. The ant colony optimization model simulates the behavior of ants and is used to optimize the operating strategies of marine renewable energy projects. Temporal Convolutional Network specializes in processing time series data and improves the prediction accuracy of the model. The attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically focus on the pieces of information that are most important for the current task. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that our method performs well on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming other models. This research is of great significance as it provides new methods and tools for improving the environmental impact assessment of marine renewable energy projects. By understanding the potential impacts of projects more accurately, we can better balance the relationship between the development of renewable energy and environmental protection, supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

In Kenya, much attention has been devoted to the array of end-user benefits from electrification; however, there are also potential supply-side benefits from building and operating electricity generating units (EGU). This study focuses on the latter by examining supply chain impacts of recent renewable energy construction projects in Kenya tracked by the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Power Africa program and construction projected in Kenya's Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP). By combining construction cost estimates with information on expenditure shares across economic sectors combined with data on wages and jobs, this study provides an assessment of the direct and indirect wage and job benefits of past and future EGU construction and operations. On-grid electrification projects tracked by Power Africa have increased domestic spending in Kenya by $1.3 billion and increased direct and indirect wages by $344 million over the ten years from 2012 to 2021. This impact could expand to $18.9 billion in domestic spending and $5 billion in nominal wages from 2022 to 2040 if the Kenyan government's LCPDP projected capacity and operations goals are met. The direct jobs required to support new LCPDP power sector construction out to 2040 could be 177,000 jobs in an average year, or 3.5 times higher than the average over the past ten years (2012−2021). Meanwhile, direct and indirect jobs supporting new power plant operations and maintenance would be 46,000 jobs in an average year, or 7 times the average over the past ten years.

The goal of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of utilizing an organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (MSWof) using a case study of local government areas (LGA) or Authority for Anambra State of Nigeria for waste to energy project. Smooth adoption of waste to energy projects requires investigation on the economic feasibility parameters necessary for such a project. This study therefore investigated the quantity of organic fraction of MSW, energy recovery and an optimum number of plants considering the economy of scales at the various LGAs of the study area. The result of the study indicates that about 198 tons maximum value of MSWof can be generated daily in Aguata LGA, with an electric energy potential value of 545 MW. The number of plants for the LGAs ranged from 10 to 50 and from 3 to 12 for small- and medium-scale plants. A large-scale plant of about 50 m3 can possibly be installed at all the LGAs, with a maximum of 4 plants in Idemili and Aguata LGA. The economic assessment based on net present value (NPV) criteria shows poor economic feasibility for a small-scale plant, while NPV was positive for medium- and large-scale plants. The internal rate of return (IRR) ranged from 0.32 to 0.94, with a general increase from small-scale to large-scale economic feasibility. This study can be replicated in other regions; it is suggested that the autonomy of the various LGAs in the country should serve as a major motivation in adopting bio-energy projects independently, and this study will serve as a decision toolkit in the appropriate scale to be adopted.

The PV plant uses micromorph thin-film solar modules (a-Si/μc-Si) technology. The photovoltaic module systems (PVS) were evaluated from May 2015 to December 2020 (around five and a half years of operation), and the electricity was injected into the internal network of the low-voltage power supply. Performance evolution has been conducted in this work as stated by the IEC61724 guideline. The monthly and annual performance indicators analyzed and assessed consist of reference yield, array yield, final yield, system losses, capture losses, PV module efficiency, system efficiency, inverter efficiency, capacity factor, and performance ratio. The annual electricity production is 3688.28 kWh, 3188.25 kWh, 3306.28 kWh, 3136.05 kWh, and 2952.81 kWh for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 operating periods, respectively. The solar park's total produced energy yield over the monitored period and the quantity of CO2 emissions avoided are 16,271.67 kWh and 14.17 tons, respectively, which can significantly contribute to and help in purifying the environment from pollution. In addition, the energy results produced by the PVS were compared to those found by the four widely used PV simulation tools (PVsys, PVGIS, NREL's PVWatts® Calculator and Solar Med-Atlas). Furthermore, this work investigates and quantifies the degradation phenomenon of solar PVS power output after five years and a half years of outdoor exposure. There is around 0.22 % degradation per year. When this rate was compared to other studies conducted worldwide, it was shown to be highly appropriate. Technical-economic research was also conducted, revealing that the system's PVS period, which establishes its sustainability, is between 9 and 12 years. The results demonstrate that micromorph thin-film modules perform better and are more efficient under harsh real-world outdoor environmental conditions. Inventux modules preserve most of their better performance even with increasing module temperature. This kind of PV module technology is low-insensitive to the highest PV module temperature. Compared to the literature, micromorph thin-film technologies are better and preferable than crystalline modules under desert environmental conditions. The results also indicate that grid-connected solar park plants using this kind of technology are feasible in the hot arid climate to produce electricity and may participate in future energy projects in the country.",Degradation | Desert climate | Economic analysis | Grid-connected | Micromorph thin-film | Performance assessment | Rooftop PV Modules | Simulation tools,5,0,,,,undefined,

Existing potential maps show that wind and solar resources are abundant in Colombia, but these studies do not consider the multiple restrictions developers face when a project is considered. This paper proposes a methodology to determine the areas with the best characteristics to develop wind and photovoltaic solar farms in Colombia, using Geographic Information Systems that depict the distribution of the physical, biotic, economic, cultural, and political characteristics restricting or conditioning the implementation of these projects. To consider financial performance, the LCOE associated with each location was subsequently calculated, and the environmental characteristics were assessed through interviews with a group of experts. Maps were developed where the areas with potential can be viewed, classified according to their profitability and the ease of developing a project at that location. The most promising locations for wind and solar farms for the continental territory of Colombia were determined integrating levels of difficulty in the environmental management, and financial project performance. The results were unified in a tool useful for stakeholders, decision-makers, researchers, and investors, in which basically no technical knowledge is required for its interpretation.

This review is relevant in the context of climate change mitigation strategies and the achievement of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Wind energy can be harvested at competitive costs to solve society’s energy poverty and climate change problems. Firstly, we present the current wind energy installed capacity and wind power generation status globally and in Mexico and discuss why Mexico is lagging behind, particularly since 2020. Despite this lag, several state governors are still considering wind energy developments. The current economic context is then considered, with community wind energy as a solution forward for wind energy development, using a successful case study from the UK that has addressed energy poverty and provided an additional income source for an island community. Any community energy project using wind as its main energy resource relies on accurate wind energy assessment in its feasibility analysis. Thus, an evaluation of different wind energy atlases for Mexico was performed, which showed that models considering microscale processes could lead to a relative difference of more than 50% when compared to those that do not consider them. This led to the conclusion that microscale effects must be considered in wind energy characterization models. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that wind faces other challenges, such as the effect of future climate change scenarios, grid planning, and vulnerability and risk associated with tropical storms, which can be substantial in Mexico. Solutions are proposed in the form of possible wind power generation scenarios, planning and implementation of centralized and distributed transmission lines, and possible wind siting and technological choices to reduce the vulnerability and risk to tropical storms. Finally, we close with some future perspectives for researchers and decision-makers. The main conclusions are that sustainable growth can only be compatible with a transition to renewable sources of energy, energy community projects can address energy poverty and achieve sustainable development goals, wind energy feasibility studies need to include microscale effects, return of investment can be improved by siting the wind farms in regions of low vulnerability and risk to extreme events, and high-voltage transmission lines are crucial for sustainable development, even with the important role that distributed systems play. Finally, turbine growth and materials recycling, among other factors, must be considered when assessing the environmental impacts of wind farm decommissioning.",energy policy | environment and climate change | Mexico | social and economic development | sustainable development goals | wind energy,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,DANIDA,17-M01-DTU,Udenrigsministeriet

The practice-based assessment utilized the developed scenarios depending on changes in foreign and domestic international credit ratings of the country. The study of the impact of political risk for three stages of RE projects was carried out. Based on the results of the analysis, conclusions were drawn about generally insignificant influence of political risk on the economic efficiency of Russian RE projects. Recommendations for the development of state support programs in the event of the impact of political risks only were generated.

The prediction and characterization of solar irradiation relies mostly on either the use of complex models or on complicated mathematical techniques, such as artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithms. This mathematical complexity might hamper their use by businesses and project developers when assessing the solar resource. In this study, a simple but comprehensive methodology for characterizing the solar resource for a project is presented. It is based on the determination of the best probability distribution function (PDF) of the solar irradiation for a specific location, assuming that the knowledge of statistical techniques may be more widely extended than other more complex mathematical methods. The presented methodology was tested on 23 cities across Morocco, given the high interest in solar investments in the country. As a result, a new database for solar irradiation values depending on historical data is provided for Morocco. The results show the great existing variety of PDFs for the solar irradiation data at the different months and cities, which demonstrates the need for undertaking a proper characterization of the irradiation when the assessment of solar energy projects is involved. When it is simply needed to embed the radiation uncertainty in the analysis, as is the case of the techno-economic valuation of solar energy assets, the presented methodology can reach this objective with much less complexity and less demanding input data. Moreover, its application is not limited to solar resource assessment, but can also be easily used in other fields, such as meteorology and climate change studies.",irradiation | Morocco | predictive models | probability distribution function | satellite data | solar energy,1,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Our results suggest that social protests have a significant effect on the time elapsed before receiving qualification, particularly for smaller projects. Following an extensive review of the literature and public documents, it is likely that social protest usually operates alongside observations raised by local communities during public consultation, and consequently, projects take longer in addressing those observations. In addition, our results suggest that the presence of social protest does not influence the qualification of the project. However, there is a relationship when social protest is examined in interaction to the productive sector, in which energy projects that face social protest are more likely to be rejected compared to mining or other economic sectors.",Environmental conflicts | Environmental impact assessment | Public participation | Social protest,2,0,,,FONDECYT,Iniciacion/11181188,Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico

This changes the priorities of both countries and, accordingly, transforms the risks. Objectives of the research: to build an algorithm for identifying anthropogenic environmental risks in the context of two major players economic activities in the Arctic region: the Russian Federation and China. In the paper, we formulated an algorithm of environmental risk identification. We identified environmental hazards from the main parameter—the type of economic activity for the extraction of energy resources, premises, and factors for the occurrence of environmental hazards and compiled criteria for risk selection. Methods used: complex analysis (mixed method research): empirical and comparative methods, methods of expert assessments, the method of inductive statistics (inferential statistics) to compare the perception of risk at the level of different groups. Results: the algorithm has been formed for determining risks in the changed external conditions. Major anthropogenic environmental risks are identified from the perspective of the main players in the Arctic—Russia and China, which can help to make the necessary decisions on time and partially prevent environmental degradation. This makes it possible to identify the risks associated with conducting economic activities for the extraction of energy resources in the Arctic region.

More research efforts will be needed on the institutional capacity and arrangements, coordination between auctions and other procedures and appropriate inclusion of auctions in policy mixes. The trade-offs between different criteria should be the focus of more rigorous and quantitative marginal analysis, identifying the extent to which improving a given criterion worsens another. The existence, causes and consequences of underbidding, the implications of the just energy transition for the performance of auctions and auction design, the marginal impact of the level of design elements and the interactions between design element choices in “design element packages” merit more attention. There should be a greater focus on the micro-level in the assessment of the success of auctions and auction design. At a methodological level, assessments of auctions with case studies should coexist with more quantitative studies on the topic, using a wide range of methodologies.

However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology's sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL. Predictive energy, environmental and economic modelling also offers water–energy–land–food–resource analysis parameters, thus delivering multi-attribute performance profiles that solve many of the current problems with the “technology unknowns” of floatovoltaics that impede energy project commissioning and licensing approvals.",Floating PV impact assessment | Floating solar simulation model | Floatovoltaic performance profiling | System dynamics sustainability | Theoretical characterisation of FPV | WELF nexus indicator assessment,2,0,,,,undefined,

In this study, wind speed distributions are examined to calculate two Weibull parameters (shape and scale) using the Matlab software, which is frequently employed for modeling and offers accurate estimates of wind resources. These parameters are derived from a year of measured wind speed data collected in El Fnidek, Dakhla, and Essouira, Morocco. Six methods are presented for estimating the Weibull parameters: the Empirical Method of Justus (EMJ), the Empirical Method of Lysen (EML), Wind Energy Pattern Factor Method (WEPFM), the Graphical method (GRAPH), Alternative Maximum Likelihood Method (AMLM), and Method of Four Moments Mixture (MFMM). The comparison of these methods is based on four scoring criteria to assess goodness-of-fit, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Chi-square (X2), and Correlation Coefficient (R2). The results indicate that the AMLM, GRAPH, and EMJ methods are the most successful in computing Weibull parameters. Additionally, the Annual Energy Production (AEP) and the economic analysis were calculated by using RETScreen software. The wind turbine models used in this study are the Sinovel 1500/77 and the Guodian Power UP77/1500, which have been considered for the production of 60 MW of electric power from the wind energy farm installed in three cities in Morocco: Dakhla, El Fnidek, and Essouira. According to the study results, the Guodian Power UP77/1500 has higher annual production with lower installation costs, making it a more favorable option. The resource analysis highlights Dakhla as a location with good potential for wind farm deployment compared to other sites. The comprehensive assessment of wind data, Weibull parameters, and economic aspects contributes valuable insights to the field of wind energy forecasting and decision-making for renewable energy projects.

To overcome the water scarcity and electricity problems facing the MENA region, the developed cooling/preheating small PVT-RO desalination plants have been proposed as a practical solution. To achieve sustainable water and energy development in the MENA region, this study presents a commendable and highly efficient renewable energy project for freshwater production and electricity generation to solve the energy crisis and water scarcity in the MENA countries. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cooling/preheating small PVT-RO desalination plant to facilitate freshwater supply to remote regions and produce electricity. This was done by connecting photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) collectors with reverse osmosis (RO) desalination systems, where seawater is used as a medium to cool photovoltaic cells to increase electric power generation and at the same time recover thermal energy and use it in the initial heating of feed seawater before it is fed into the RO plants, thus increasing its productivity. The results indicate that using the photovoltaic thermal panels as preheating units will lead to a 0.135 kWh/m3 reduction in the rate of specific electricity consumption for the RO desalination plant, as well as increase the electricity generation from PVT panels by a rate of 8%.

Thus, solar energy projects in different areas obtain different economic and environmental efficiency. The installation of rooftop solar power systems has had a quick move in Vietnam in the past years; however, the assessment of the economic efficiency of these systems within the country is still limited. This research aims at conducting a comparative assessment of the economic and energy efficiency and CO2 emissions of 10kWp household rooftop solar power projects in the seven different regions of Vietnam, including Hanoi, Quang Binh, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, Binh Thuan, Binh Duong and Dong Thap. This study designs a 10kWp rooftop solar power system and uses these models as a reference to simulate, evaluate and compare economic and energy efficiency and CO2 emissions among the selected projects. The software used to simulate energy efficiency is PVsyst. The economic indicators of the project calculated include the payback period (PB), internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and benefit cost ratio (BCR). The results show that the two projects in Khanh Hoa and Binh Thuan Province have higher power outputs than the rest. In economic terms, the projects are not really effective due to the long payback period and low NPV, IRR and BCR.

This paper aims to determine the net CO2 emissions resulting from implementing a Direct Air Capture (DAC) system in tandem with a renewable energy project, offsetting emissions being generated during power generation in Trinidad and Tobago using a gate to grave life cycle assessment (LCA). A comparison between the storage capacities of different reservoir types, a saline aquifer and depleted hydrocarbon reservoir, was accomplished by keeping all reservoir parameters constant with the exception of the fluid models in each. It was determined that a solid sorbent DAC would be most suitable for this project, with the LCA showing that net CO2 emissions were -799 kgCO2e/ton of CO2 stored. From the comparison of the different reservoir types, it was determined that saline aquifers have greater CO2 storage potential than depleted hydrocarbon fields, with almost double the capacity being seen for this case. An economic analysis was lastly performed, utilizing carbon credits as a revenue source, to determine the project’s financial feasibility where it was determined that the minimum price at which credits could be sold to achieve breakeven is $347USD/ton.

However, conflicts between different interests, values and priorities, particularly at the community level, can constrain this transition. This paper aims to analyze lines of conflict and opportunities to build bridges between conflicting interests in the expansion of wind energy in Germany at the local level, to achieve successful implementation of wind energy projects. Results: Our analysis of four cases of local-level wind energy projects in Germany shows that limited local options for action reinforce the need for local actors to maximize the benefits of energy transition projects. In addition to the conflict over scarce space, the lines of conflict at the local level run primarily along the dimensions of costs and benefits, winners and losers. Real or perceived procedural and distributive injustices had the potential to fuel resistance to wind energy projects in the analyzed cases. However, wind energy projects were successfully implemented despite the presence of local opposition. Conclusions: The results show that, by integrating procedural and distributive justice into the project planning and implementation and offering tailored solutions, community support for expansion of renewable energy projects can be enhanced. The paper advances the concept of societal ownership (“gesellschaftliche Trägerschaft”), which suggests the willingness of members of a community to tolerate decisions even when some conflicts related to the decision remain unresolved. Societal ownership is presented as an alternative to the concept of simple acceptance; it implies a more positive, more supportive community attitude, where members aim to address conflict as a normal aspect of decision making. Rather than sweeping alternative opinions aside, the community addresses alternative viewpoints, seeking to achieve greater procedural and distributive justice. In this way, a sense of societal ownership of a project can develop, enhancing its likelihood of success.",Conflict resolution | Energy transition | Gesellschaftliche Trägerschaft | Societal ownership | Trade-off | Wind energy expansion,6,1,repositoryam,Green,BMBF,undefined,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung

Offshore wind energy projects have been promptly suggested in Vietnam due to policy advancement, with the country's excellent wind resources. The success of an offshore wind energy project is decided mainly by choosing the best location for offshore wind power station (OWPS) construction, which is a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with the coexistence of conflicting factors. There is a problem with incomplete decision information use and information loss during the decision-making process, and it is easy to overlook the interaction difficulty in a fuzzy environment. To address the complex nature of the prioritization problem posed, this study proposes a hybrid MCDM framework combining the spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS). SF-AHP is used in the first stage to determine the significance levels of OWPS evaluation criteria. WASPAS is then utilized to rank locations of OWPS. A comprehensive set of evaluation criteria developed based on the concept of sustainable development has been recognized by reviewing the literature review and interviewing experts to practice the two-stage MCDM model. A real case study for Vietnam is conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The best location schemes have been determined by using the decision framework.

An online questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the project on people's lives, their overall assessment of the project and their willingness to support similar future initiatives. The data show that the economic benefits are not significant when people assess the project, while on the contrary other factors like the environmental benefits, sense of pride, technical parameters institutional seem to have a greater effect. The environmental and institutional factors are also among the ones that influence people's willingness to support and participate in future projects.

In its expansion strategy, technical, environmental and socioeconomic aspects should be taken into account to identify suitable areas for development of wave energy projects. In this research we provide a novel approach for suitable site identification for wave energy farms. To achieve this objective, we (i) developed a conceptual framework, considering technical, environmental and conflicts for space aspects that play a role on the development of those projects, and (ii) it was operationalized in a Bayesian Network, by building a spatially explicit model adopting the Spanish and Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zones as case study. The model results indicate that 1723 km2 and 17,409 km2 are highly suitable or suitable for the development of wave energy projects (i.e. low potential conflicts with other activities and low ecological risk).

The question however is, when, among other things, it would be possible for such projects to achieve self-sufficiency. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to study the economic efficiency of Russian RES projects as a prospect for their functioning outside of state support programs. Fifty-two solar, wind, and hydropower projects, which have received support in the form of a capacity-based support scheme in 2018–2020, were selected as the objects of research. The methodological basis of this work is the classical method of investment analysis, supplemented by an industry-specific approach. The efficiency assessment was carried out for the 15-year period of projects’ state support, as well as for the entire designed operation period of power plants. The dependence of the projects’ economic effect on a combination of factors, including the type of project, the commissioning period, regional affiliation, capital expenditures, etc., were studied. Based on the results of the analysis, the conclusions about the current unpreparedness of the Russian RES sector to operate in a competitive market were substantiated; proposals for the development of programs to support the sector were formulated. A unique factor that has a significant impact on the achievement of a positive economic effect by such projects – the value of specific capital expenditures – was identified. The obtained research results are of practical and methodological significance. They will be used in the development of a methodological approach to assess the effectiveness of the rejection by the Russian RES market of state support tools at certain stages of the projects.",capacity-based support scheme | capital expenditures economic efficiency | energy market | hydroelectric power | investment analysis | renewable energy | solar power | state support | wind power,2,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,MK-4549.2021.2,Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation

The first hurdle to overcome is providing accurat e information for decision-makers and potential investors. In the case of renewable marine energy, this means generating data on the possible installed electrical capacities of the various sources at sites across the country. From this, it is possible to estimate the economic viability of implementing renewable energy projects at specific locations. This work, therefore, aims to characterize the available power from diverse energy sources around the coasts of Mexico and to make recommendations of sites where the energy potential warrants further analysis. A literature review of the power available from marine currents, waves, and thermal and saline gradient sources was performed for the Mexican Caribbean. Several sites were found to be geographically viable; there is sufficient potential energy available to meet at least part of the energy demands of the Yucatan Peninsula and Cozumel Island. Key sites are to the south of Cozumel Island and in the Cozumel Channel for energy harvested from ocean currents. In the northern part of Quintana Roo, sites offer great potential for wave energy, while the central part of the state could be suitable for energy generation from thermal gradients. In Chetumal Bay, there is potential for saline gradient electricity. Wave energy potential was evaluated for the entire Mexican coast, and seven locations are recommended for further investigation. A conservative gross estimation has shown that wave energy could contribute up to 0.2 % of the national demand in the short or mid-term, with a relatively small investment and a low environmental impact.",available ocean power | Marine energy | marine plants deployment locations | renewable sources installed capacity,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To examine the developed index system and risk evaluation method, an overseas hydropower investment project is chosen and the risk factors are analyzed. The results suggest that the risk level of the enterprise's project is highest, the political and environmental risks are both high, the economic and project risks are both at average level, and the energy risk is relatively low, which verifies the effectiveness of this information fusion method.

Currently, there is little assurance from policymakers in committing to climate change pledges: taking the Middle-East and North African (MENA) region as a specific case with using 2019 as a cut-off period. We conducted an interim assessment of the Paris Agreement to ascertain whether climate actions are in tandem with emissions reduction targets. Making use of difference-in-difference technique as a quasi-experiment supported by fixed-effects and placebo treatment models, the results point to evidence of less than 1% effective CO2 emissions reduction as of 2019 compared to the 2015 level. The current carbon emissions reduction commitment level is far-reaching contrary to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged (16.43% on average by 2030 compared to the 2015 level). The analysis suggests that achieving NDCs commitments are currently major burden on policymakers since the economic development is highly linked with nonrenewable energy consumption. Furthermore, a more comprehensive framework when accounting for all available renewable and clean energy projects shows reduction levels in the range of 30%–40% from 2020 to 2030. These results suggest that the Paris Agreement in MENA countries may be more effective from 2020, thus underscore the importance of capturing ongoing projects (involving renewable and clean energy technologies) into interim policy assessment.

Consequently, the choice of renewable energy technologies should be based on a comprehensive assessment addressing the different dimensions that are affected. Clean energy technologies are traditionally evaluated on the basis of their techno-economic performance. Such an approach penalises emerging energy technologies that are generally more capital-intensive given their innovation requirement and the lack of support mechanisms facilitating their industrial roll-out. In this paper, a multi-criteria evaluation framework is proposed encompassing three important broad dimensions: techno-economics, environment and socio-economics. The applicability and flexibility of the proposed evaluation framework are demonstrated on different case studies. First, the hypothetical deployment of a floating offshore wind farm both in Scotland and Portugal is evaluated. Later, the proposed framework is used to evaluate the deployments of wave energy devices in the same two locations. The results show that this multi-criteria approach provides a more holistic overview of the performance and implications of renewable energy technologies, particularly emerging ones, and can better support decision- and policy-making in the medium- and long-term.

The perceptions of proximate residents to the changes and uncertainty induced by WTE projects are the main reasons for such conflicts. Determining the indicators used to measure these changes is crucial for an evaluation of surrounding residents’ risk perception. One indicator is residents’ risk perception thresholds. Our paper employs evolutionary game theory to deduce the risk perception threshold of surrounding residents related to a WTE project, which provides a novel contribution to the literature. The results of a case study and simulations show that the level of the risk perception threshold has a crucial effect on the behavior choices of surrounding residents. Two important parameters that affect the value of this risk perception threshold are possible economic compensation and possible resistance costs. A change to the values of these two parameters can change the value of the risk perception threshold of nearby residents. If the change in the risk perceived by surrounding residents is lower than the threshold they can tolerate, they will accept construction of the project. However, if surrounding residents are worried about this risk fluctuating as a result of construction of the plant, they will behave more cautiously and conservatively, and if the possible risk exceeds the threshold that they are willing to tolerate, then they will boycott the plan and protest against the construction of the project.

Annually, 1.9 billion tons of MSW is generated with each person contributing 218 kg of MSW to this projected grand total. In Kampala, the annual MSW collection exceeds 350,000 tons which is disposed at the city's landfill which has exceeded its capacity. This has side effects including environmental contamination, methane gas generation promoting global warming, and labour issues. No research has been conducted towards assessing the potential of energy recovery from the city's MSW by incineration. In this paper, the techno-economic assessment of energy recovery from MSW in Kampala city using incineration was done. Waste data was collected through sampling upon delivery at the landfill. Chemical composition of the waste was determined by proximate analysis and calculation of the elemental composition followed by determination of the calorific value. A MSW incineration plant was designed based on a mass burn incineration. The design parameters were determined using thermodynamic equations and Peng Robison's equations of state. Simulation was done using Aspen Plus and Aspen Hysys, for a plant combusting 220,000 tons per annum of MSW at a feed rate of 27 tons of MSW per hour. The economic analysis was done assuming that the project was a Public Private Partnership debt financed by 75 % with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 5 % margin over a term of 15 years. Results showed that the composition of the waste was largely organic with an 80% composition. The Lower Heating Value was 6.12 MJ/kg with a moisture content of 25%. The elemental composition was 43.47% Carbon, 5.52% Hydrogen, and 41% Oxygen with absence of Nitrogen and Sulfur. The ash content was reported at 6.65 %. From the simulations, the plant is capable of exporting 774 kWh of electricity per ton of MSW to the national grid, capable of powering 1,062 medium income households in Uganda. A capital investment of USD157 million with the sale of electricity and a gate fee as the sources of revenue for a project running for 25 years was considered. The resulting Net Present Value was USD 30 million with a project Internal Rate of Return of 12.6 % and a payback period of 6 years. Thus, the present study demonstrates the possibilities to increase the adoption and use of renewable and clean energy, prioritise energy efficiency, and biodiversity for a green and sustainable Kampala city. Moreover, the results provide immediate technical information for policy makers and potential investors in the development of waste to energy projects in Uganda.",Aspen Plus and Aspen Hysys | Incineration | Municipal solid waste | Simulation | Waste characterisation,18,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

They have become crucial for increasing electricity access in developing countries, particularly in more remote locations. However, while access to such services can significantly contribute to socio-economic development, the functionality of mini-grid schemes is often poor. Many attributes of off-grid energy projects that contribute to sustainability have been considered within the literature. However, there has been minimal integration of these attributes across the different aspects of sustainability. Furthermore, the interaction between the sustainability dimensions, and the relative importance of these project attributes driving the sustainable performance of such mini-grids have been under-discussed. In this paper we use Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and analyse a quantitative dataset obtained from a survey of 175 micro-hydro projects. A theoretical framework of attributes that contribute to the sustainable performance of mini-grid projects is presented, and the empirical analysis provides evidence supporting 14 hypothesised relationships between 10 project attributes and five sustainability dimensions.

Although the refinement of the LCOE method has led to its improvement, but there are still some concerns in the form of considerable benefits that may produce unreliable results. In order to provide the solution of drawbacks associated with LCOE method, this research work focuses on presenting an alternative costing approach. The adoption of benefit-to-cost ratio analysis (BCRA) method for the decision-making of energy systems is proposed in this work. A comprehensive assessment between LCOE and BCRA methods was carried out with a purpose to observe their influence in determining the success or failure rate of an energy project by considering the associated benefits. For this purpose, two case studies were considered; Chena Geothermal Power Plant (Alaska, United States) and Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Project (Bahawalpur, Pakistan). The assessment was carried out on the basis of different scenarios, which were developed according to the obtainable benefits from a particular project. The results show that, compared with the LCOE method, the BCRA method is more feasible and practical in energy project decision-making process.

This topic is also very relevant for the Russian energy market that is otherwise dominated by oil and gas. The Russian Ministry of Energy forecasts that local power plants running on the renewable energy sources (RES) may not become economically efficient until 2025 or later. However, a research question arises: Is it possible to effectively implement RES projects in Russia without any state support? In order to answer this question, the authors need to assess the economic feasibility of seven scenarios for the construction of a solar power plant in the Orenburg region of Russia. The methodological basis of this work is the widely used in the energy sector classic method of investment analysis based on the calculation of discounted indicators: net present value (NPV), payback period (DPP) and internal rate of return (IRR) of the project. All our calculations are based on industry-specific initial capital investment estimates, energy storage equipment costs, and related annual operating costs. This led to the development of the scenarios on the basis of an analysis of the features of electricity and capacity generation in the Orenburg region, the existing options for joining the trading system of the energy market, energy storage applications, as well as the availability of the Russian government support and funding for the solar energy projects. Our results demonstrate that the economic feasibility of the development of renewable energy in Russia can become a reality. Out of the seven scenarios, three yielded the positive economic outcome (among them there were the two project scenarios without government support). These two projects featured the sale of electricity in retail markets and the installation of an additional energy storage system, despite an almost twofold increase in capital investments. The projects in question achieved the best economic results according to the three calculated criteria. In particular, the scenario that provided for the work on the retail market directly to the energy consumer receives an NPV of more than 1.5 times higher than other projects, an IRR of 10% and pays off at least 3 years faster. Achieving a positive economic result in the wholesale market was possible only in case of state support for the project. In addition, this scenario of the project numerically reached almost identical indicators, as in the case of selling energy on the retail market in the region where the power facility operates: NPV is almost 127 million rubles, IRR is within 13.9%, and DPP is 15 years. Other scenarios that do not provide for the use of energy storage systems or do not have state support for working in the wholesale market are not self-sustaining even during the 25-year life of energy equipment. These results might have practical significance and will be used in developing an approach to creating a profile of regions in terms of the advancements of renewable energy, as well as in developing strategies for the incentives of this sector in Russia.",economic efficiency | energy storage | government support | renewable energy | Russia | solar energy | solar power plants,7,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,"Government Council on Grants, Russian Federation"

The results indicate that understanding the conceptual and formal relations of operating variables and financial decisions is necessary for correctly measuring shareholder value creation and making rational decisions, even for those projects (such as solar energy projects) where the operating, technical component is of paramount importance. We show how a firm's decision of replacing conventional energy with solar energy may be affected by managerial decisions regarding the firm's payout/retention policy and its financing policy to support the project. The model discloses insights on how to fine-tune the financing and distribution decisions in order to maximize the value creation for shareholders. We apply the model to a real-life photovoltaic project to be located in the province of Modena, in Northeast Italy, and quantify the effect of financial decisions on the project's net present value, showing that the financing and distribution policies may amplify or shrink the impact of changes in other inputs and may even revert an otherwise unprofitable project into a value-creating one.

Today, state policy is largely based on the paradigm of development of the Arctic as a “thing-in-itself,” possessing great value, but institutionally, ideologically, and economically disconnected from all other Russian regions. The Arctic policy predominantly neglects the substantial industrial, research, technological, transport, and human potential of the Siberia and the Far East. Such an approach is fraught with aggravation of the continental curse of Siberia and some regions of the Far East, with the risks of unfulfilled potential of profit-oriented Arctic projects—not considering the possibilities of their integration into the economic-spatial system of added value generation in the country. Based on an analysis of domestic and foreign Arctic state policy, a number of implemented and scheduled infrastructure and energy projects in the region and scientific and public discourse on the regional development of Russia, this paper proposes a number of measures to improve Arctic strategic management. The paper highlights the need to revise the current paradigm of Arctic development and transform the Arctic into a zone of innovative resource and nature-saving development that generates multiplicative effects for the socioeconomic development of Siberia and the Far East.",Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation | continental curse | multiplicative effects of development | Siberia and the Far East | state Arctic policy,1,0,,,ВШЭ,undefined,National Research University Higher School of Economics

Seven of these, at locations distributed throughout the Kingdom, have recently provided highly accurate data, which are used in the present paper to perform an economic assessment for off-grid renewable energy projects based on load data for a typical Saudi Arabian village. Using future projections of capital costs, this paper analyses wind/battery, PV/battery, and PV/wind/battery systems for projects in these seven location starting in 2019, 2022, and 2025, thus facilitating the planning of when and where to schedule installations. Wind/battery systems have a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) 2.2 to 3.2 times higher than PV/wind/battery and PV/battery systems except in Yanbu, a windy coastal city. In 2019, PV/wind/battery systems have the lowest LCOE in Yanbu ($0.112/kWh) and Sharurah ($0.118/kWh), whereas PV/battery systems are preferable in Al-Jouf, Al-Wajh, Hafr-batin, Jeddah and Riyadh with a range of LCOE from $0.119/kWh to $0.129/kWh. The projected decline in PV and battery costs to 2025 is more rapid than the decline in wind turbine costs so that if projects are deferred, PV/battery systems have the lowest LCOE in each location in 2025. In that year Al-Jouf and Jeddah have the lowest LCOE ($0.711/kWh) and Hafr-batin has the highest ($0.76/kWh). Part of the reason for solar being more economic than wind is the better hourly and monthly match between generation and load, a large proportion of which is air conditioning. As a further contribution, this paper provides a geographical summary of results for policymakers to prioritize cities for the implementation of off-grid RE systems in Saudi Arabia going forward.",HOMER | Levelized cost of energy | Net present cost | Saudi Arabia | Solar | Wind,10,0,,,,undefined,

PTC provides a tax credit of 1¢–2¢ per kilowatt-hour for the first 10 years of electricity generation for utility-scale wind, and PTA is a rebate provided by the local governments to wind farms in the U.S. Midwestern states. Past researches suggest that the breaking-even of renewable energy projects can partly be attributed to PTC. However, in cognizance of the irregular availability of such incentives, there seems to exist a need for financial feasibility analysis of the wind farms. The study uses a stochastic method and a scenario approach to address this research question. The analysis considers the capital and operating costs, interest payments, local and federal taxes, and production of wind energy and sales revenues, and inherent uncertainties in key parameters. The results shed some light on the impacts of PTC and PTA on the financial feasibility of wind farms in the U.S. Midwestern states.

Since energy projects tend to be meant for the long term and involve considerable financial investments, it is indispensable to be aware of the country-specific regulatory background when establishing photovoltaic (PV) systems. The last few years have witnessed a trend that new PV power plants are mostly built using traditional crystalline PV technologies, which are prone to irreversible PV module damage due to shading effects. During the operation of PV power plants, anomalies causing loss of income and even fire hazard in extreme cases may occur. Thus, the identification of the problematic parts of the system is of utmost importance. This paper presents the energy relationships of shading by the example of a Hungarian PV system. The goal of this study is to introduce a methodology that can be used internationally to categorize the operational characteristics of the strings of PV power plants on the basis of monitoring data, which allows the assessment of the annual energy loss. The innovative novelty of the model is that its use can provide practical help for the operators of PV systems around the world, since the solution is easy to adapt to real-time supervisory and management platforms and it makes the localization of problematic strings possible, thusly allowing a more focused inspection of PV power plants. The novel practical benefit of the model is that by its use it becomes possible to detect any energy loss resulting from the spacing distance of the strings of PV power plants or faulty operation (the negative shading effects of trees and other objects, faulty inverter operation) by using a simpler calculating mechanism. The early detection of problems is essential for the protection of the PV modules, the subsequent reconstruction of the strings or even solving issues under guarantee. In addition, by assessing the annual energy loss caused by shading, it becomes possible to detect any negative change in the economic indicators of the investment.",Experimental analysis | Hot spot phenomenon | Photovoltaic | Shading | Solar energy,18,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NKFIA,undefined,"Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap"

Several research efforts have been made with the support of Pakistan Meteorological Department in the last two decades for wind resource assessment (WRA) across the country. However, the practical installation of wind farms is quite a fraction of the total forecast wind energy potential. In this feasibility, WRA of Umerkot and Sujawal districts located in Sindh provinces of Pakistan has been analyzed by analyzing mean wind speeds, estimated Weibull parameters, power and energy densities calculation for various heights of selected wind turbines. Further, this paper analyzes the overall energy potential for these locations with implementation cost and pay-back period for investment. These locations are selected by the World Bank initiative of wind profiling campaigns to record wind speed data during 2016 and 2018 with 10 min resolution. It is observed that Umerkot and Sujawal sites are suitable for energy production. The highest values of power and energy densities for Sujawal are 414.18 W/m2 and 3628.22 kWh/m2∕Yr and for Umerkot these values are 303.86 W/m2 and 2661.81 kWh/m2/Yr. The results indicate that using Nordex N90/2500 wind turbines are highly beneficial for Umerkot and Sujawal. The associated costs of energy are 0.074 $/kWh and 0.056 $kWh respectively and the payback period is estimated to be around 7 years with 20 years life time of the project. This work suggests the possibility of wind farm installation and commissioning based on power density calculation and cost of land acquisition. This work emphasizes the investment for wind farms at Sujawal and Umerkot for the sustainable growth of the country.

Only three countries viz. Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Samoa use biomass for power generation. This paper aims to (i) quantify the forest logging residue generated in Fiji, (ii) carry out a techno-economic and environmental assessment of a potential 10 MW biomass power plant (BPP) in Fiji and study the impact of feedstock cost (FC) on the electricity production cost (EPC) in relation to the financial viability, and (iii) discuss possible strategies to overcome challenges PICs face in developing biomass energy projects. It is found that a 10 MW BPP would require approximately 60,000 tonnes of biomass feedstock, which can be supplied by forest residue from logging in the western division of Viti Levu in Fiji. If the FC is taken as USD68.6/tonne and electricity export tariff to national grid is taken as USD0.1621/kWh, then the net present value is USD16.1 million, simple payback period is 5.6 years, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is 2.5. A sensitivity analysis reveals that electricity export tariff, availability of power plant, and feedstock costs are critical parameters affecting the NPV of the project. Various strategies such as utilising forest residues, planting short-rotation plantations in unused land, enabling policies, early stakeholder engagement, attractive electricity export tariff, and using appropriate harvesting and transportation technologies can help develop the biomass-based power sector in Fiji.",Biomass power plant | Electricity export tariff | Energy production cost | Feedstock cost | Forest residue | Pacific islands,8,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Generally, costs and benefits—both economic and environmental—are weighted through a single constant discount rate. This leads to excessive discounting of the present value of cash flows progressively more distant over time. Evaluating energy projects through constant discount rates would mean underestimating their environmental externalities. This study intends to characterize environmental–economic discounting models cali-brated for energy investments, distinguishing between intra-and inter-generational projects. In both cases, the idea is to use two discounting rates: an economic rate to assess financial components and an ecological rate to weight environmental effects. For intra-generational projects, the dual discount rates are assumed to be constant over time. For inter-generational projects, the model is time-declining to give greater weight to environmental damages and benefits in the long-term. Our discounting approaches are based on Ramsey’s growth model and Gollier’s ecological discounting model; the latter is expressed as a function of an index capable of describing the performance of a country’s energy systems. With regards to the models we propose, the novelty lies in the calibration of the “environmental quality” parameter. Regarding the model for long-term projects, another innovation concerns the analysis of risk components linked to economic variables; the growth rate of consumption is modelled as a stochastic variable. The defined models were implemented to deter-mine discount rates for both Italy and China. In both cases, the estimated discount rates are lower than those suggested by governments. This means that the use of dual discounting approaches can guide policymakers towards sustainable investment in line with UN climate neutrality objectives.",Cost-benefit analysis | Dual discounting | Energy policy investments | Energy transition index | Social discount rate,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

A typical 10 MW power plant was modeled using empirical parameters based on the Steam Rankine Cycle. Woodchip samples were collected and energy properties, fuel demand, eucalyptus area required and unit variable cost were determined. In economic analysis, NEWAVE (Long and Medium Term Interconnected Hydrothermal Systems Operation Planning Model) and ANAFIN (Financial Analysis Model for Electrical Projects), both developed by CEPEL (Brazilian Electrical Research Center) were used for the first time to analyze forest biomass projects taking into account fuel availability and hydrological risks. Three energy trading scenarios were evaluated: (1) full commercialization in Brazilian regulated market, (2) full in free market and (3) partial in both markets. Results showed that 4,200 ha of eucalyptus plantations would be needed to ensure sustainable woodchip supply. Moisture content, basic density and woodchip price played an essential role in determining future costs. All scenarios of energy trading were economic feasible, and scenario (3) mitigated energy spot price risk and might be considered the effective risk-return strategy.

The proposed methodological approach provides an opportunity for a qualitative and quantitative assessment of state support of renewable energy production in the studied countries. The results of the study demonstrate that the key drivers of influence on the renewable energy market are expanding access to financing for renewable energy sources, reducing the share of traditional energy sources and ensuring public-private support for renewable energy projects. Using correlation-regression modeling, the relationship between the socio-economic indicators of the studied countries and the main indicators of the development of renewable energy (the number of renewable energy business entities, facilities, and their total installed capacity) was determined.

In this case, the authors of the article conducted a significant analysis of existing methods for assessing project risks and the choice of the Monte Carlo methodology is due to the practical orientation of the study. In practice, the real enterprise is quite problematic to use more complex methods of assessment, such as methods of Real Options or methods of fuzzy logic, neural networks, etc. As a method of qualitative risk assessment (from the second category) the method of expert evaluation with subsequent calculation of risk premium in the discount rate was chosen. This method is common in practice and easy enough to implement. According to the results of the analysis (statistical and expert) the most dangerous risks of energy projects were identified: Production and technological risks (the risk of choosing the wrong technological scheme, the risk of reducing the quality of internal controls, the risk of incorrect calculation of the design capacity of energy production, the risk of industrial safety), security risks (the risk of hacking attacks on information systems of energy enterprises), as well as country risks. Among the most influential risks (based on the analysis of their impact on the main technical and economic indicators of the project) are: The risk of rising prices for purchased gas (fuel), the risk of high volatility of the dollar exchange rate. The results of the study were used in a real project and the risk assessment methodology was implemented in the project activities of Mondi Syktyvkar enterprise.",Energy Industry | Investment Projects | Monte Carlo Method | Project Risks | Risk Assessment | Simulation Modeling,20,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

The present study explored the potential of energy recovery from biorefinery landfills by means of in-situ thermal processing of municipal solid waste (MSW) with a techno-economic analysis and using RETScreen clean energy project analysis software. An environmental assessment was performed to validate the sustainability of the proposed process. The biorefinery landfill uses existing MSW landfill infrastructure to move from a disposal-only paradigm to a product-creation paradigm. This innovative concept can reduce the extra costs of ex-situ conventional power plants by avoiding waste transportation to a secondary site. A case study in Atlantic Canada was employed to optimize energy reclamation from MSW via two principal pathways: (1) Rankine cycle steam power plant and (2) gas turbine. A plant with a 30 t h−1 capacity and 2 MW power production was proposed as a base case. The results indicated that the gross reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions was 1115 t CO2 greater for a gas turbine than a steam cycle. Further, for a steam power plant, the capital cost was approximately three-fold higher, and the operating and maintenance costs were nearly eight-fold higher than a gas turbine plant. Study results will encourage progress towards a sustainable biopower system and lay the foundation for comprehensive analysis of renewable resources like MSW. The key outcomes of this study target growth of the circular bioeconomy. Moreover, they can serve as the basis to draw recommendations on the techno-economic feasibility of implementing such biorefineries, specifically at high latitudes where energy costs are relatively high.",Environmental analysis | Gas turbine | In-situ gasification | Process intensification | Rankine steam cycle | RETScreen,15,0,,,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills produce greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which, if not managed properly, may cause global warming. However, landfill gas could also be a potential source of electricity in areas like Africa, where there is low electricity accessibility. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the economic feasibility and environmental impact of landfill gas to energy project in urban areas of Africa. An economic feasibility analysis was conducted using the net present value and levelized cost of energy methods. Besides, environmental impact analysis was performed using life cycle assessment method. Key findings showed that landfill gas to energy project has positive net present value in all the countries except Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, Guinea, Malawi, and Ethiopia. It was also realized that levelized cost of energy for the project in urban areas of Africa in 2012 was from $0.076/kWh to $0.870/kWh. The environmental impact analysis showed that on the average, landfill gas to electricity project could reduce global warming potential by 72.2%. However, it has been observed that electricity generation from landfill gas could increase acid gas emissions by 8.75%–9.00%.

While a multitude of models and tools are currently available, there are no means of identifying the most appropriate or accurate methods, especially considering uncertainty. The main objective of this study is to compare and identify the strengths and limitations of various mathematical modelling techniques used in energy planning for grid connected renewable energy systems. As a case study demonstration, different multi-objective optimization techniques with and without uncertainty consideration (i.e. robust optimization, linear optimization, Taguchi Orthogonal Array method, and Monte Carlo simulation) were applied on a selected neighborhood in British Columbia. The optimization outcomes and the time and effort for evaluation were compared for the different methods. The findings indicate that robust optimization can be used to develop an uncertainty-based decision model. It significantly reduces evaluation time compared to the other methods. Although the presence of uncertainties can change the optimal configuration of a planned energy system, the assessment method itself does not significantly impact the outcomes. The findings of this study will enable the energy planners and researchers to compare different multi-objective optimization techniques, and to select the best for planning renewable energy projects, especially during the pre-project planning stage.",Community energy planning | Linear programming | Monte Carlo simulation | Renewable energy | Robust multi-objective optimization | Uncertainty modelling,18,0,,,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Social, environmental, and economic aspects were considered as key to determine the suitability of energy projects. A comprehensive analysis on social acceptance and resilience towards renewable energy and the conditions for communities to benefit from these projects were studied followed by an analysis of the availability and capacity of renewable energy sources in Mexico, as a case study. A set of indicators related to the three pillars of sustainability was developed to assess the conditions of each place with the best renewable resources in the country. The life cycle and capacity factor of each technology were also considered. A mathematical model was developed to determine the most suitable locations and technologies for power generation. The results showed a trend towards the states of northern Mexico, especially those bordering the United States, as the most viable for electricity generation. The most appropriate technology is wind energy. Oaxaca, the state with the best wind resources and current leader in wind power generation in Mexico is, by contrast, the least viable state for wind generation, as has been later confirmed by scientific evidence, as wind facilities are associated with severe socio-cultural and economic damage in host communities in this state.",Biomass | Environmental indicators | Mathematical model | Renewable energy | Social acceptance | Solar energy | Sustainable development | Wind energy,8,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

However, landfill gas estimations, analysis of its energy capacity, and economic analyses need to be performed properly for a landfill project area. Although there are many gas prediction models in the literature, the default values in the model such as the methane production capacity (Lo) and the methane production rate (k) need to be recalculated according to the climate and waste composition of the region in order to obtain a more accurate gas estimation. Furthermore, the energy project from waste is expected to evaluate the through lifetime with variables (landfill operation, gas collection efficiency, different combustion engines, etc.) for an optimum plant capacity. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the landfill gas and methane production potential that can be obtained in landfill areas in different provinces of Turkey and to determine an optimum plant capacity by performing energy production cost analysis. To achieve this, the LandGEM 3.02 version was used to estimate long-term landfill gas potential in this study. The Lo value was calculated by using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodology, and the k value was determined by considering the meteorological data of the regions (precipitation amount, etc.). The future population of the selected regions was estimated using the arithmetic increase method. According to this estimation, the solid waste quantity to be generated in the future was calculated. Energy capacities of these areas were calculated using internal combustion reciprocating engines with six different capacities. The unit energy production cost was evaluated by employing the levelized cost method.

Energy derived from biomass residues may provide even more benefits because it may replace other sources of higher-grade energy while providing proper destination for residues. Biomass from pruning residue has been overlooked as an energy resource due to many limitations. This paper addresses the issue and the means for energy valuation of pruning residues while provides final destination for them. It presents a framework to overcome most of today's challenges across the world. A case study was carried out to determine the main constraints and how they can influence the decision-making process. The variety of urban pruning residues and their rate of generation, handling, storage, logistics, economic and environmental issues, institutional regulations for a small city in Southern Brazil were taken into consideration in the analysis. Pruning residues were sampled in the field, then handled, shredded, dried, specified, stored and burnt in a concurrent woodburning furnace for testing. The diagnostics of the constraints and the lab tests were summarized and organized in a framework that aimed to assess the energy valuation of pruning residues. Results show that with proper assessment tools, projects, biomass analyses and burning technology energy valuation of pruning residues can be feasible.",Bioenergy | Biomass | Energy projects assessment | Energy valuation of waste | Renewable energy | Urban pruning residues,9,0,,,CNPq,312.615/2018–3,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

This paper proposes an innovative model designated as, the ‘Community-owned Energy Storage’ model. This model proposes that community-owned solar projects should sell their locally generated electricity under a Time of Use Power Purchase Agreement (TOU PPA). Results demonstrated under the developed model of community-owned solar projects can fully restore the economic viability and become financially attractive if they could utilise a combination of TOU PPA and demand-side response (DSR) services.

Planning in the rural section and the effort in solving the problems of farmers lead to increase their interest in farming and manufacturing in the villages and decrease their migration to the cities and metropolitans. Therefore, the present study aimed at feasibility of electricity to a rural household in Iran using off-grid solar-based hybrid system. Design/methodology/approach: In renewable energy projects, a successful evaluation requires suitable criteria so that one can properly analyze the operational behavior of all feasible scenarios. In the present paper, HOMER software has been used for this purpose for a village with no access to electricity grid (Bar Aftab-e Jalaleh, Iran). Due to drastic fluctuation of fossil fuel prices and varied solar radiations in various years because of climate change, sensitivity analysis has been performed using HOMER. Findings: In the optimum status economically, 70% of needed energy is provided by solar cells at the price 0.792 $/kWh. The comparison between the optimum condition economically and the condition that only use fossil fuels revealed that the return on investment will occur after less than 2 years and have remained profitable over 23 years. Social implications: The authors hope that the results of this study can be used in planning of the authorities to realize the interests of people in this village. Originality/value: According to the surveys, despite Iran being the first country in terms of providing solar power to the villages, so far no socio-economic-environmental assessment has been done for a solar cell-based micro-grid in an off-grid mode for a remote village that is deprived of electricity from a national electricity grid. In addition, for the first time in Iran, the effect of the fuel price and solar radiation parameters variability on the performance of system have been investigated.",Costs of Energy | Rural electrification | Sensitivity Analysis | Solar Radiation,32,0,,,,undefined,

A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the results of a European city-survey to uncover areas highly relevant for the successful implementation of local SE projects. The insights gained aid policymakers to better understand implementation barriers, leading to the development of more effective actions and policy interventions towards the implementation of SE projects.

In 2014 the government of Mexico introduced the SIA in response to the social conflicts around RE projects. The SIA has generated some favorable changes in the sector's social management. Yet, its effectiveness is constrained by diverse issues related to its institutional and regulatory design, government implementation, practices of companies and consultants, and restricted social involvement. Moreover, the sector's socio-technical arrangement (priorities, organization, experience, and policies) strongly influences the performance of SIAs and accounts for the lack of consideration of social aspects in project design and planning. We argue that without a substantial internalization of the social dimension in the priorities, policy, and planning of RE, the SIA would be limited to a problem-fixing role, which would constrain the effective management of social impacts.",Energy transitions | Impact assessment | Renewable energy | Social impacts | Sociotechnical transitions,22,0,,,,undefined,

This paper presents a geographical information system based approach in combining suitability analysis, spatial biomass assessment and optimality analysis to locate plants for bioelectricity generation with sustainable availability of single or multiple biomass. First, fuzzy multi-criteria analysis was employed to identify the suitability of plants’ locations, using local economic, environmental, and social sustainability criteria. As well, the availability of multiple types of biomass was assessed. Biomass availability information and land use data were combined to generate high-resolution spatial biomass information with user-defined resolution. Next, a location-allocation model was used to identify optimal locations for biomass energy plants by considering both road networks and spatially distributed biomass availability. Additionally, different scenarios were analysed to optimise plant sizes, biomass delivery costs and total number of plants for the region under both single biomass and multi-biomass approaches. The developed model was demonstrated for a Queensland case study using sugarcane waste alone and combined sugarcane waste and forest waste. Results using sugarcane waste in Queensland identified optimally located plants with sizes from 57 MW to 185 MW and average transportation distances of 27 km to 64 km. By combining sugarcane waste with forest waste, the plant sizes increased, depending on spatial biomass availability. This methodology can be extended to evaluate optimum configuration and optimum combination of different biomass types at a plant level.",Bioelectricity | Biomass energy plants | Geographical information system | Location-allocation | Multi-biomass | Single biomass,51,0,,,QUT,undefined,Queensland University of Technology

The study examines the influence of boundary conditions on the optimal design characteristics of the ORC CHP system within heating plant backfitting project. The optimisation task is solved for given site-specific technical, economic, ecological and legal constraints. The proposed methodology for synthesis of new technological structure takes into account long-term operational experience and results of measurements of a given reference plant. Although the methodology is general, the solution presented in the paper is relevant for Polish DH sector. The analysis considers country specific system of financial incentives for renewable energy projects as well as participation in electricity balancing market and European Trading System (ETS). Thermal energy storage is considered as a solution providing flexibility of CHP system operation. Influence of different electricity, biomass, coal and EUA (European Emission Allowance) prices on optimal size and structure of the cogeneration system is examined. The analysis revealed that economic optima are relatively flat and the range of ORC unit size, for which the value of objective function is close to the optimum is quite wide. Although Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) suggest slightly different size of the system, the recommended solutions are the ones with relatively long annual time of operation. The optimum size of ORC for a DH system of approximately 30 MW peak heating output is within the range of electric power of 1–2 MW. It was also found that although market prices and support instruments are nowadays different than at the time of commissioning of the reference plant, the size of the ORC unit is still close to the optimal value. Implementation of thermal energy storage (TES) in the form of hot water storage tank moves the optimal rated electric power of the ORC generator slightly towards higher values. On the other hand, only a small improvement of financial performance is gained by implementation of TES. Considerable improvement of economic performance has been reached after anticipated increase paths for electricity and EUA prices were introduced. In this case however, the recommended optimal size of the ORC CHP remained almost the same as in the case of constant prices.",Biomass | Cogeneration | Decarbonisation | District heating | Heat storage | ORC,23,0,,,,undefined,Politechnika Śląska

It is useful than both for management and cash-flow monitoring purposes at operating stages. Investors putting money into power generation projects expect an appropriate rate of return to compensate them for a minimum acceptable real return available in the market (risk-free rate of interest) and the project’s specific risk. Due to its essential nature in the financial and economic evaluation of projects (it is the only parameter that reflects the risk), it is reasonable to assume that investors would also be interested in constituent components of that indicator. The discount rate is one parameter in the discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account the risk of a venture. Further, the previous research in this area has focused mainly on the dimension of this variable, and the structure of this parameter has not been dealt with any other studies. The proposed idea of this study met the expectations of the industry—it aimed to present a typical project implemented in the energy industry, a relatively simple methodology that allowed estimating the components within the cost of equity capital of the enterprise. In the power generation sector, one can find various types of discount rates—assessed for multiple technologies, at different development stages, and expressed differently. Owing to the know-how and decades-long experience, coal-fired power projects’ remarks may be a good benchmark for alternative low carbon technologies. That is why, in this work, a discount rate for valuing investment in new coal-fired power projects was evaluated. This assessment was made on the “bare-bones” assumption, meaning evaluations at 100% equity, after-tax, in constant (real) currency units. The analysis of the discount rate structure was performed by applying the procedure of the classical sensitivity analysis having the accuracy of key input parameters. Finally, the risk factors within the risk-adjusted discount rate were calculated. The obtained results showed the importance of individual risk factors within the risk-adjusted discount rate used in coal energy projects, which would enable a more pragmatic approach to controlling this parameter by decision-makers and understanding the risk.",Cash-flows | Coal-fired power generation | Cost of capital | Discount rate | Economic evaluation | Investments,110,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

A sustainability project that does not consider any of these parameters can generate resistance among different actors of society. In this work, we have demonstrated that the traditional definition of sustainability encompassing economic development, environmental protection, and social justice does not adequately cover large-scale renewable energy projects. We have presented an illuminating case study of solar development in the Yucatan state of Mexico to show that the traditional three-legged stool of sustainable development fails to accommodate local power relations and their role in energy decision-making. This point is made through a substantive and illuminating ethnography of a solar project in the community of San José Tipceh, which involves the importance of energy democracy and understanding power relations in any assessment of sustainable development. These power relations are an important component of sustainable development, and all megaprojects, especially renewable energy projects, require special attention in the governance processes. Through an analysis of an example of implementation of a mega solar project, we argue that the methodology through which the power is exercised is an exercise of great importance because it leads us to a scientific discussion that structures an international reflection on sustainability. The case study consists of mixed methods, including several techniques to deepen the analysis of sociocultural aspects, and tries to present the limits and show the weakness of the sustainability perspective in such megaprojects. It is concluded that environmental justice as a basic element of the new era of renewable energies is limited and can generate social injustices. In the same way, this work shows how power is exercised in the implementation of energy projects and in the absence of equitable comprehensive governance that does not consider the local sociocultural contexts of the communities, resulting in the generation of new powers and permanent conflicts. At the end of this work, a framework to empower local sociocultural contexts for an equitable energy transition is recommended.",Energetic capitalism | Energy democracy | Indigenous community | Renewable energy megaprojects | Social resistance | Sustainable development,21,1,repositoryvor,Green,CONACYT,IA102620,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Municipal solid waste generation potential and methane generation potential from landfills of each of the districts were estimated from 2019 to 2038. Economic viability analysis of landfill gas to energy project based on Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy, and Payback Period was conducted. Besides, environmental impact analysis based on greenhouse gas emissions potential was evaluated. Key results indicate that the generation potential of municipal solid waste during the project period is 55,000 to 2,120,000 tons/year. Chaoyang district has the highest municipal solid waste generation potential, while lower municipal solid waste generation potential was observed in Mentougou district. It is also found that Chaoyang district had the highest electricity generation potential of 8,400,000 to 218,300,000 kWh/year. Findings of the economic feasibility analysis show that landfill gas to energy project is viable in all the districts. However, the project is highly viable in Chaoyang district with more positive net present value ($181,100,000), shorter payback period (1.3years), and lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0613/kWh). Greenhouse gas emission potential of landfill gas without energy recovery was the highest in all the districts. It was realized that landfill gas with energy recovery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72.3% in all the districts.

However, poor economy associated with limited income, funds availability, and regulations governing project funding and development are key factors that challenge investors in the energy sector. Given the various power generation resources, including renewables, it is necessary to evaluate the possible power generation investment options from an economic perspective. To realize this objective, solar PV, wind and diesel power generations are economically compared, considering the incremental rate of return and incremental benefit to cost ratio techniques. The alternative investment options of distributed generation technologies are evaluated for Maharashtra, India under different depreciation methods, and the effect of the latter on selecting the best investment candidate is investigated. The paper also conducts sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, and fuel cost variations on the selection decision considering a comparison of the different general projects' cash flow structures discussed in the literature. The economic aspects of selecting a project among possible alternatives for an investment in the power sector are analyzed, and the presented review provides comprehensive comparisons with respect to the literature approaches. The results reveal that, in the benchmark case study, the PV project is rejected and disregarded from further comparisons with other candidate projects since its equity internal rate of return (10.25%) is less than the minimum accepted rate of return, leaving the selection between wind and diesel energy projects. The study reveals that the incremental rates of return under such a comparison are 37.88%, 45.94% and 37.50% when MACRS, declining balance and straight line depreciations techniques are applied, respectively. Thus, the wind energy project is the favored option in this case. For the economic assessment of other case studies, the application of both sensitivity analysis on the capital cost and operation and maintenance cost and literature approaches to structure the projects reveal that wind energy for Maharashtra, India is a more attractive and feasible option compared to other distribution generation projects, while diesel is only considered to be a good option when its fuel cost is reduced by 5%. Finally, the paper highlights policy implications that can influence the decision to move towards investment in distributed generation technologies as a future research direction.",Benefit to cost ratio | Depreciation methods | Distributed generation technologies | Incremental rate of return analysis | Modified accelerated cost recovery system | Policy implications,22,1,repositoryam,Green,KU,FSU-2018-25,"Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research"

The program may promote vegetation restoration, increase the proportion of households engaged in off-farm labor, and improve forest management, and thus contribute to enhanced forest quality. However, studies of RFFP's impact on forest quality at the community level remain inadequate. The purpose of this study was to test the following hypothesis: that RFFP implementation would lead to a significant difference in forest quality between communities with RFFP implementation versus those without. Twelve communities in Southwest China were selected as subjects, all being rich in biological and cultural diversity but have high poverty rates. We conducted a linked analysis combining forest quality data with socio-economic data to examine the effectiveness of RFFP at the community level. Forest community data were obtained through field surveys in July–August 2014, and socio-economic data was collected using a questionnaire survey. A forest quality index system was constructed using factor analysis, and the difference in forest quality between village that did and did not implement RFFP were compared. Key environmental and socio-economic variables affecting forest quality were identified by a constrained ordination method. Our results show that neither the structure, diversity, biomass nor soil fertility of the forest communities were not differed significantly between the village communities with and without RFFP. Elevation, fuelwood harvesting and solar energy projects contributed markedly to forest quality, suggesting that the RFFP probably did not directly drive the existing differences in forest quality among the 12 communities. Both natural and socio-economic factors affect forest quality. Considering current rural livelihood needs and the goals of expanding forest cover and improving forest quality, ensuring that land users have a meaningful voice in decisions about forest regeneration and establishing compensation mechanisms for forest management may be key directions to pursue in the future for sustainable development.",Environmental condition | Forest quality | Returning Farmland to Forest Program | Socio-economic survey,41,0,,,NSFC,2019HB2096001006,National Natural Science Foundation of China

This study presents a framework that prescribes the necessary stages that allow a robust project evaluation to take place. The framework should assist practitioners in ascertaining if renewable energy projects, such as wind turbines and hydro-electric generators, contribute to energy cost savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions. The conceptual framework was developed using empirical data accessed from an 850-kW wind turbine case study and a 40-kW hydro-electric case study and embraced the action research methodology. Both renewable projects are based in Ireland. The 850-kW wind turbine project was found to display disappointing results. As part of the electrical generator power quality measurement, it was found that there was large dispersion in the wind turbine output signal where the coefficient of variation values of between 128% and 939% were recorded. The simple payback period for the wind turbine investment is 7.34 years. The assessment of the 40-kW hydro-electric project found that positive values could be attributed to the environmental, economic, and social aspects of the project. Coefficient of variation values of between 2.8% and 3.9% were calculated for the hydro-electric plant with a simple payback period of fewer than two years. It was found that the dispersion value affects the actual financial and environmental benefits of the project. This is the first time that the short-term dispersion characteristic of a renewable generator power output signal is considered as part of the power quality analysis. Measurement of the quality of renewable power outputs should include the short-term ramping, dispersion, characteristic of the power signal. An implication for stakeholders is that the short-term ramping variation of renewable energy generators must be measured in each evaluation process.",CO  emissions 2 | Corporate social responsibility | Renewable energy systems | Sustainable development,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

This work studies the financial risk associated with the anticipation or delay in the completion of projects in the Brazilian energy market considering the insertion of photovoltaic sources in an integrated wind-solar power plant. To evaluate the project feasibility, Net Present Value is used as deterministic method and Monte Carlo Simulation is performed as stochastic valuation model through some historical data obtained. The economic risk assessment showed that delayed works significantly increase the probability of a failed business regardless of the proportion of the sources in the integrated system. Projects finished earlier, in contrast, increase the chances of a profitable business, although this increase is less significant in systems with lower installed photovoltaic source and more relevant to systems with a higher proportion of integrated solar source.",Advance and delay in energy projects | Brazilian energy market | Net present value | Photovoltaic power | Stochastic analysis | Wind power,10,0,,,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

However, current approaches inherently limit application to specific locations and wave energy converter architectures, rather than providing for broad application across the industry. Generally, a site is identified based on either the gross resources, or an assessment of minimal conflict with current ocean users. This chosen location defines the wave characteristics and a specific Wave Energy Converter (WEC) technology is identified. The predetermined wave characteristics and associated device performance then determine the final power production. This is a ‘bottom-up’ type approach. The current work introduces a novel ‘top-down’ approach. The new approach incorporates a novel device-agnostic performance constraints and economic considerations to identify priority development sites over broad coastal regions. The technological constraints are represented by frequency and directional screening functions, derived from the power matrices of four conceptually distinct WEC devices. This screening process estimates the extractable portion of the wave resource. Subsequently, a Net Revenue Index (NRI) is developed that characterizes the economic potential based on proximity to existing electricity markets and site-specific installation costs. Hot-spots are identified based on the screened extractable resource and economic analyses to represent both long and short term development opportunities. This ‘top-down’ approach is demonstrated through a case study of the West Coast of Vancouver Island. For both the screened wave resource and NRI data, hot-spots formed from locations exhibiting values in the 90th percentiles are identified. If fully developed, the resource hot spots potential is ~67,000 GWh of annual energy delivery, while hot-spots based on NRI represent economic hot-spots present 21,000 GWh of annual energy delivery. Intersecting the two collections of hot-spots results in 336 km2 with an average of wave energy flux of 35 kW/m.",GIS | Marine spatial planning | Remote community integration | SWAN | Wave energy | Wave energy converter,17,0,,,,undefined,

To overcome the alarming challenges persisting in the energy grids, Pakistan must focus on system protection, grid reliability, distribution and transmission, and power quality. The inefficiencies in grid protection and management signify an overall problematic energy scenario. The solutions to these problems include the improvement of domestic, commercial, and industrial demand-side management and the reduction in distribution network losses. A smart grid (SG) is a critical requirement as it can overcome the shortcomings of the existing grid owing to its promising features, enhanced consumer empowerment, utmost security; efficient and optimized energy flow; and demand-supply management. Thus, the SG is essential to overcome the energy crisis in Pakistan and achieve the standards of other developed nations in the energy sector. This study aims to highlight the significant prospects of SGs within Pakistan with the key objectives of its availability requirements. We compare the energy scenario in Pakistan with that of other countries and recommend various aspects that require improvement through SG implementation. Additionally, we discuss the incorporation of renewable energy resources and present a market analysis regarding SGs to illustrate the SG scenario and its implementation in Pakistan. Moreover, we analyze and evaluate detailed taxonomies of energy generation, energy projects, renewable energy assessment, power market trends in Pakistan, and the basic requirements of SGs. Furthermore, a critical analysis of the energy sector in Pakistan is elaborated, which describes the possibilities, requirements, and strengths pertaining to the transformation of the modern electric grid with respect to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The optimization of offshore wind turbine substructures with regard to costs and reliability is a promising approach to increase competitiveness. Today, interdisciplinary analyses considering sophisticated engineering models and their complex economic effects are not widespread. Existing approaches are deterministic. This research gap is addressed by combining an aero-elastic wind turbine model with an economic viability model for probabilistic investment analyses. The impact of different monopile designs on the stochastic cost-efficiency of an offshore wind farm is investigated. Monopiles are varied with regard to diameters and wall thicknesses creating designs with increased lifetimes but higher capital expenditures (durable designs) and vice versa (cheaper designs). For each substructure, the aero-elastic wind turbine model yields distributions for the fatigue lifetime and electricity yield and different capital expenditures, which are applied to the economic viability model. For other components, e.g. blades, constant lifetimes and costs are assumed. The results indicate that the gain of increased stochastic lifetimes exceeds the benefit of reduced initial costs, if the overall lifetime is not governed by other turbine components' lifetimes.",Economic viability | Lifetime distribution | Offshore wind energy | Stochastic cost-efficiency | Substructure design,9,0,,,FP7,609795,Seventh Framework Programme

Detailed spatial analysis revealed specific zones suited for the efficient installation of energy power plants. Zones with an energy surplus factor of less than 0.2 are deemed not viable for development, whereas regions with factors less than 0.4 are ideal for harnessing solar, wind, and biomass resources. Furthermore, zones with surplus factors greater than 0.6 are highly recommended for energy projects. Notably, the results show that strategic development of these zones can cater to between 45 % and 68 % of the country total energy demand, potentially reducing the CO2 footprint by 0.5. Moreover, with an increase in the construction threshold, the CO2 reduction potential has shown a decrease to 1.29E+08 tones, particularly evident in areas with rigorous construction standards. A plateau in reduction figures is observed once the construction threshold surpasses 3.5, stabilizing between 2.5E+07 tones. As the threshold exceeds 5, a further stabilization is noted, consistently around 2.17E+07 tones, persisting even when the threshold approaches 8.

Food waste can be converted into hydrogen gas, which can be utilized to generate power without emitting any harmful pollutants. This solution would also help with the issue of disposing of food waste. The conversion of food waste into hydrogen is a practical energy source with potential financial benefits. This study explores the transformative potential of converting food waste into renewable energy through hydrogen production, focusing on Bangladesh from 2023 to 2042. Notably, the study forecasts a surge in food waste from 23 million tons in 2023–110 million tons by 2042. By 2042, food waste is expected to generate 2480 MW of power, a rise from 489 MW in 2023. Based on the results of the economic study, the food waste into hydrogen via gasification project is financially viable in all of Bangladesh's main cities. Metrics such as internal rate of return, payback period, levelized cost of energy, net present value, and total life cycle cost were used to assess economic viability. The hydrogen production cost, payback period, and internal rate of return are 2.05 $/kg, 11 years and 14% respectively. It was discovered that using the available electricity from hydrogen gas may displace 1428 M liters of diesel fuel combustion. The quantity of diesel fuel saved can cut carbon dioxide emissions by 3.85 million tons. It was also found that using hydrogen as a source of energy generation has an attractive ecological efficiency of 99.98%. This research provides novel and pertinent data for investors contemplating gasification-based energy projects in Bangladesh.

Ecological and economic assessment of the effectiveness of implementing bioenergy technologies for processing organic waste in conditions of technogenic and military risks, while also addressing the need to reduce the extraction of fossil fuels. Methodology. The advanced global experience in bioenergy development is analyzed and considered using modern methods for calculating the technological parameters of biogas plants and determining the economic indicators of their effectiveness. The techno-economic evaluation and justification of the prospects of biogas energy are performed considering the regulatory framework and legislation of Ukraine and the European Union. Findings. With the development of individual biogas plants, the daily output can make approximately: biogas – 370 m3, electricity – 700 kW, thermal energy – 1100 kW. The total value of realized resources per year of operation amounts to €60,370 (of which: electricity – €31,467; thermal energy – €10,907; liquid organic fertilizers – €17,996). With investments of around €270–300 thousand and an annual profit of €21,870, the payback period of investments reaches 12–13 years. Originality. The scientific justification for the prospect and necessity of developing biogas energy in Ukraine has been established to improve overall energy security and the eco-economic efficiency of developing low-waste technologies alongside reducing the extraction of energy resources and greenhouse gas emissions. Assuming the improvement of the regulatory framework for biogas extraction and implementation in line with EU standards, as well as grant funding from various partner countries, the payback period could be reduced from 12 to 5–6 years, which is an acceptable indicator for small private enterprises. Practical value. The practical implementation of the proposed perspectives for the development of Ukraine’s energy sector in the conditions of post-war recovery will reduce dependence on fossil fuels, increase the overall level of environmental and economic efficiency in the energy sector. The possibility of reducing the payback period of capital investments in “green energy” projects by half for farm enterprises has been justified, which positively impacts the environment and energy security of Ukraine.",biogas plant | economic efficiency | energy security | organic waste processing,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze

Many nations around the world have laws requiring regulators to meaningfully assess potential climate impacts when reviewing proposals for new fossil fuel infrastructure projects such as oil and gas extraction leases, major transmission pipelines, and power plants. However, reviewing agencies often report lack of appropriate tools to objectively assess the climate impacts of individual fossil fuel infrastructure projects, and to determine the significance of these impacts. Here we present a novel methodology to fill this critical gap by providing a science-based decision support tool, a ‘climate test’, for use in determining an infrastructure project’s carbon emissions significance. The climate test defines emissions significance quantitatively according to a project’s consistency with region-specific constraints and characteristics of climate mitigation pathways, considering both emissions and energy systems characteristics over the project’s lifespan. We showcase the tool here, using an example of a natural gas pipeline to explore how often and under what conditions the project would ‘pass’ the climate test with an emissions significance result of ≤1, which indicates alignment with a 1.5°C goal. For this project, less than 1.2% of 10,000 scenarios yielded significance values ≤1, suggesting a high likelihood that the project has a significant climate impact, a determination that would be robust to uncertainty for such a project. This emission-based metric represents a first step toward a broader framework to align project-level infrastructure decisions–including and beyond new fossil energy projects–with climate, as well as economic and societal, policy goals.",climate policy frameworks | decision analysis | energy policy | environmental impacts | Fossil fuels | policy instruments,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted into the atmosphere contribute significantly to this issue. They have diverse impacts on climate, ecosystems, public health, and socio-economic systems, highlighting the need for comprehensive mitigation and adaptation strategies. To address this problem and minimize GHG emissions, renewable energy sources have emerged as the most promising alternative for power generation. These sources offer a sustainable and clean alternative to fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution, and fostering energy independence. In the context of this study, a 100 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) station was proposed in Ma’an, Jordan, as a sustainable solution. The effectiveness of this PV station in mitigating GHG emissions was evaluated by comparing it to a base case involving an oil station. To perform this analysis, RETScreen software, a widely recognized tool for assessing renewable energy projects, was used to examine the environmental impact of switching from a conventional energy system to a renewable energy system. The results obtained from the analysis revealed a remarkable reduction in annual gross GHG emissions in the proposed case compared to the base case. Specifically, the emissions would be reduced by 89%, translating to an annual reduction of 49.9 tonnes of CO2. These findings underscore the significant potential of the proposed solar PV station in curbing the emissions responsible for global warming. By significantly reducing GHG emissions, the solar PV station con-tributes to creating a more sustainable future, aligned with the principles of environmental preservation and climate change mitigation.",CO  reduction 2 | greenhouse gas emissions | renewable energy | RETScreen | solar photovoltaic system,0,0,,,,undefined,

Although renewable energy offers the potential to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, broaden energy resources, and reinforce energy security within BRICS nations, this dimension remains relatively unexplored. This study addresses a research gap, unveiling how governance, “information and communication technology (ICT)”, and financial development impact renewable energy generation in BRICS from 2000 to 2020. Employing the STIRPAT framework, the study takes a comprehensive, systematic econometric approach. Empirical findings show that ICT trade can effectively boost renewable energy production in BRICS nations. Good governance plays a pivotal role in connecting ICT with renewable energy generation. Conversely, financial development negatively affects renewable energy production, while economic growth and foreign investments enhance it. Causality analysis supports a feedback loop between economic growth and renewable energy, but there is a one-way link between renewable energy, financial development, ICT, and foreign investments. The study underscores the importance of making a clean environment a top governmental priority to achieve environmental goals: to enhance renewable energy in BRICS, bolster governance in energy projects, and concurrently implement green ICT strategies to facilitate renewable energy initiatives.",BRICS | Clean energy | Environmental sustainability | Green initiatives | Technological advancements,2,0,,,,undefined,

Anaerobic digestion (AD) has attracted the scientific community due to its simplicity and easiness to handle, and has the potential to utilize any kind of organic waste to produce a mixture of combustible gases, i.e., biogas and digested slurry, which has further applications in agriculture, solid biofuels, and purification. The process, in turn, reduces the local waste and helps in recycling in a manner that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, conserves the resources, and establishes a circular economy in the time of undetermined future for the production of energy and safe disposal of the waste. However, the conventional processes encounter with the low biogas yield and long retention time, which discourage the developers. To enhance biogas yield and quality, the momentum of research has increased towards implementation of advanced techniques for development of efficient processes. The present article summarizes the effect of different operational parameters on AD and impact of advanced techniques for enhanced biomethane/biogas. The article further covers the life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic aspect (TCA) of the AD process. This will provide the comparison of different advanced techniques in terms of biomethane/biogas yield.

One of the most important indicators for evaluating sustainable development is the modified pure arrangement (GS). For this purpose, this index was used as a sustainable development index. The results indicate that the effect of positive impulse on renewable and renewable energy consumption on sustainable development in Uganda is positive. In addition, the positive shock of renewable and renewable energy consumption increases the emissions of carbon dioxide pollutants to a different extent. In addition, the effect of the growth of sustainable development index on renewable energy consumption and renewal energy consumption is (CO2) negative.

In such circumstances, this study examines the extent to which foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, stock market capitalization, and research & development expenditures affect clean energy demand in the major investment countries, spanning the period from 1996 to 2017. The empirical results of long-run elasticities show that FDI inflows and research & development expenditures play a considerable role in promoting clean energy consumption. Further, it is indicated that clean energy consumption has a negative effect on carbon emissions, but a positive effect on economic growth. Research & development expenditures and FDI inflows, meanwhile, have a significant negative impact on CO2 emissions. Based on the results, the study recommends that policy makers in the major investment countries should understand that it is worth investing research & development expenditures as it is encouraging the use of clean energy and supporting lower carbon emissions.

Given that the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions increases until 2050 will come from low- and middle-income countries, finding cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change while meeting development targets is essential. However, recent research has shown some of the limitations of broad financing mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and existing carbon markets. This has resulted in a growing interest in designing novel investment support schemes, such as modifications of feed-in tariffs (FiTs) that may be more cost effective and better targeted towards particular outcomes when compared to traditional deployment subsidies or broad financing mechanisms. We evaluate the design and outcomes of one such novel support schemes: the GET FiT (Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariff) investment support scheme in Uganda, which has attracted ~ 453 million USD in private sector investment for 17 small-scale renewable energy projects (solar, hydro, bagasse) in only three years. Using financial modelling on detailed project-level data, we find that most projects were additional and would therefore not have been built without the subsidy. In addition, using firm-level panel data, we show that power outages hamper manufacturing performance in Uganda. In the absence of reliable outage-data for the entire Ugandan territory, we use nightlight variations to proxy changes in outages. We show that outages have declined substantially since the introduction of GET FiT. Yet, our analysis also demonstrates that programmes to incentivise additional renewable generation in developing countries funded internationally or domestically should liaise closely with grid authorities to ensure that supply does not outstrip demand.",Climate policy | Developing countries | Economic productivity | Feed-in-tariff | Financial additionality | Renewable energy,20,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Our approach reformulates geothermal assessment as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), employing algorithmic decision-making techniques to devise an approximately optimal data acquisition strategy.

This research aims to quantify the willingness to pay (WTP) of urban residents in the Mekong Delta for the environmental and social benefits associated with renewable energy projects. By analysing their preferences and priorities regarding renewable energy implementation, this study aims to contribute to the increasing knowledge on the drivers of sustainable energy transitions in developing regions. Methodology / approach. This paper leverages a choice modeling (CM) framework to analyse the economic viability of renewable energy investments in Vietnam. The CM technique is advantageous for its ability to capture individual preferences for complex goods or services characterised by multiple attributes and trade-offs. This enables a detailed assessment of the diverse economic values associated with renewable energy sources, beyond their traditional energy generation capacity, including environmental externalities, social impacts, and potential synergies with other sectors. Results. Residents showed significant WTP for renewable energy initiatives improving landscape aesthetics, wildlife habitats, air quality, and job opportunities. Higher income, education, and knowledge level are positively associated with greater WTP. Younger respondents showed a strong position in favor of renewable energy sources. Households with more children were less likely to support the status quo, and married respondents were more pro-renewable. Perceived community involvement emerged as a significant factor in supporting renewable energy policies. Originality / scientific novelty. This study represents a novel application of CM within the Vietnamese context, providing valuable quantitative data for policymakers and stakeholders. By estimating WTP for specific renewable energy attributes, we inform cost-benefit assessments and support the development of efficient policies for managing renewable energy investments. This data facilitates resource allocation and prioritisation of projects with the highest societal value. Practical value / implications. Our findings underscore the crucial role of public awareness and education in driving renewable energy implementation. Residents with a clear understanding of the benefits demonstrate a higher WTP. Hence, we recommend a multifaceted communication strategy to educate the public about the environmental, social, and economic benefits of renewable energy. This involves utilising diverse channels like community meetings, media outreach, online platforms, and expert engagement to disseminate accurate and engaging information. By fostering knowledge and understanding, we can cultivate a strong public mandate for renewable energy investment, facilitating informed decision-making and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future in the Mekong Delta.",choice experiment (CE) | climate change | sustainable development | Vietnam | willingness to pay (WTP),0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Existing studies have attempted to assess what the future energy resource potential is that can be harnessed from the water environment. Although schemes harnessing this energy, particularly hydropower, have been widely developed across the UK, few of the resource assessments account for already operational sites. This study takes the initial step required to holistically assess an accurate available potential by determining where and how much of the combined resource has already been exploited. During the research it was noted that the extent of development in terms of installed capacity and locations of sites has been poorly recorded. Data collection shows that there is not a single comprehensive database of hydropower and tidal energy schemes. This study has therefore addressed this research gap collating operational hydropower and tidal energy projects. This research determines the total installed capacity of hydropower is 4.66 GW, with 82 % of the powerhouses' locality identified. The contribution of tidal energy is much smaller at 10.63 MW. This research now makes it possible to fully understand the existing hydropower picture for the UK for the first time, allowing for more accurate resource assessments to be undertaken and for a better understanding of what the current contribution of these renewable energy sources (approximately 14 %) can be towards meeting the UK's energy demand (averaging 33 GW in 2020).",Hydro-environment | Hydropower resource assessment | Quantifying hydro resource | Tidal energy resource assessment,1,1,,,,undefined,University of Strathclyde

Coal is still a vital power source for the energy sectors in the Western Balkans (i.e., Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia). The energy sector is a critical component in the five countries’ pursuit to decarbonize (i.e., follow the net zero pathways) due to its central role as a primary contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and a critical enabler of sustainability transition. This article presents a mapping exercise of development finance for five Western Balkan countries’ energy sectors. The study conducted a scoping literature review and detailed analysis of the five countries’ energy sector-related development finance flows from 2008 to 2020. This aimed to provide insights into the development finance flows for renewable and non-renewable energy sources in five Western Balkan countries. Results: The scoping literature review indicated a significant gap in knowledge about the effects and effectiveness of development finance in the Western Balkans. Data analysis identified US$3.2 billion in energy development finance in the examined countries. The disbursement ratios were above the global average of 63%. Serbia received the highest proportion of the total funding, while Montenegro obtained the highest funding per capita. The data analysis did not establish a connection between adopting the Paris Agreement in 2016 and increasing development finance flows for renewable energy projects. Around one-third of the disbursed development finance was invested in projects for energy supply using non-renewable sources. Official Development Aid loans represented 37% (US$1.2 billion) of the total funding, contributing to the increase in indebtedness in the five countries. European-based bilateral and multilateral development finance providers were the most important actors in the five examined countries. Conclusions: The amount of the disbursed development finance was insufficient to cover a significant percentage of the needs of the surveyed countries. Although carbon-intensive energy infrastructure received considerable funding, the total amount of disbursed energy development finance ranged between 0.15 and 0.62% of the average gross domestic product for the analyzed countries during the study period. Based on the research findings, we recommend that development finance providers and recipient countries pay greater attention to planning for strategic funding disbursement.",Carbon intensity | Development aid | Electric power system | Energy transition | Non-renewable energy | Renewable energy,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,Sida,15273,Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete

To effectively accommodate renewable energy, there is a growing need to develop integrated planning strategies for both renewable energy sources and transmission lines in a power system, taking into account the location-specific characteristics of renewable energy. Economically viable and rapid system expansion plans are required to resolve the problem of delayed integration of renewable energy into existing power system, which arises due to inadequate transmission facilities. To address these problems, this paper presents an integrated economic evaluation method that considers the inherently uncertain output characteristics of renewable energy, contingent on location, the costs associated with installing transmission lines, and environmental benefits. The case study is conducted using a modified power system in Korea. In the case study, it is assumed that by integrating solar power generators in a low-demand area and wind power generators in a high-demand area, wind power plants have higher construction costs than solar power generators. However, the transmission costs for wind power plants are lower than those for solar power generators due to the regional characteristics of the power grid in the installation areas because renewable energy in high-demand areas typically requires less additional power infrastructure than in low-demand areas. The results of this study show that the net benefit for the wind power plant is estimated at USD 225.4 M, while the solar power plant yields a net benefit of USD 22.9 M in the example system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, underscoring its potential to mitigate the challenges faced in the practical implementation of renewable energy projects.",energy transition | renewable energy | renewable energy development | renewable energy sources | sustainable energy,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOTIE,20204010600220,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy"

Forest biomass is a potential alternative to meet the growing demand. The expansion of thermoelectric projects based on forest residues highlights the need to assess raw materials' availability and land suitability. This is usually a problem of spatial decision and geographic intelligence under a holistic perspective since, in planning these projects, it is essential to understand the economic, environmental, and social feasibility. In this article, we propose a decision support system based on multi-criteria modeling on a GIS structure associated with a mathematical optimization model for zoning the suitability and availability of land for constructing thermoelectric power plants. The geospatial model for determining priority sites integrated various environmental, social, and economic criteria and constraints. The AHP method was used to weigh and estimate the relative importance weights of the criteria for modeling territorial aptitude. The results of the GIS stage formed the basis of a mixed-integer linear programming model that incorporated technical and economic aspects for a better allocation of financial resources. The minimized cost function included transport costs, harvesting, forestry, purchasing land/leasing land/forest outgrower schemes, and purchasing wood from the market to supply the biomass. We used a sizeable hydrographic basin in southeastern Brazil as a case study for the demonstration. The mapping of suitability and constrained zones identified the classes of preference and availability of land. The proposed mathematical model recognized sets of supply locations (new plantations or existing areas) and minimized the project's final cost to supply biomass to meet the demand of potential thermoelectric plants that are candidates for implementation.

This study applies a conflict sensitivity framework to examine how changes in energy systems alter conflict. Using the case study of the Lake Turkana Wind Farm (LTWF) and secondary sources, the study analyses the range of conflict mechanisms identified by project implementers, as well as independent analysts. Conflict mechanisms reveal how energy system changes may affect violence in the project area, as well as the kinds of socio-economic consequences of conflict generated by LTWF. The paper critically examines the discrepancies between the project developer, Lake Turkana Wind Power, and analysts of independent studies in how conflict mechanisms are attributed to pathways of increasing or reducing conflict. The paper finds that the project developer evaluates its impact on conflict in a minimal way, making conflict sensitivity limited.

We carried out a case study, which included the development, modelling, and simulation of seven scenarios using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). To measure and compare the prospective performance of the LECs in each scenario, six key metrics were evaluated and assessed. The authors find that simple, rule-based control systems might be well suited for LECs with a limited number of controllable assets that aim to provide increased levels of self-consumption of up to 3%. We also conclude that when the LEC utilises an energy cooperative business model, the selected asset dispatch method provides only minor differences in LEC performance, while for prosumer communities, the importance of selecting a suitable asset dispatch method is higher. We also conclude that LECs have the potential to significantly increase their economic performance by more than 10% by acting as aggregators and providing grid services directly to system operators.",asset dispatch | battery energy storage | energy management | local energy community | optimisation | power system flexibility | renewable energy sources,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,EC,856602,European Commission

Methods: This study utilizes a descriptive-analytical approach to describe and analyze the current reality of renewable energy in accordance with the current Egyptian Constitution and international demands for environmental protection. The study relies on a combination of primary and secondary sources, as well as scientific publications, to support the analysis and draw conclusions. Results: The study findings indicate that international climate agreements cannot achieve their objectives unless parallel national mechanisms are established to serve the same goal. The study also confirms that the legislative system in a country can significantly contribute to climate protection goals, which are a global demand, by creating a conducive legislative environment for transitioning to clean energy. Additionally, transitioning to clean energy is identified as the most effective method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, as long as there is societal awareness about environmental protection. Lastly, the study underscores the need for continuous and sustainable development of national and international legislations related to renewable and clean energy to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which have become a global environmental threat. Suggestions: It is recommended to implement comprehensive legislative reforms to support innovation and technological transformation in the renewable energy sector and develop policies to facilitate the implementation of renewable energy and streamline administrative processes. Enhancing environmental awareness and education programs is essential to promote interest in clean energy, while continuously evaluating and adapting legislative and regulatory standards is necessary to address evolving challenges.

Keeping this in mind, the present research examines the impact of consumption of renewable energy on ecological footprints for nine selected N-11 countries during the period 1990–2018. The findings of both quantile regression and long-run elasticities confirm that renewable energy consumption and per capita income play a considerable role in increasing ecological footprints across the selected N-11 nations. The results of panel causality tests indicate the presence of bidirectional causality between the consumption of renewable energy and ecological footprints. The empirical results urge that the policymakers and governments of the N-11 countries by providing profitable incentives, a successful public-private partnership can invest in renewable energy projects, due to this, ultimately, moving N-11 countries towards sustainable development and reduce ecological footprints in the long run.",Ecological footprint | Economic growth | Life expectancy | Population density | Renewable energy consumption,42,0,,,,undefined,

However, in developing countries, investment is challenged by high capital expenditures and several uncertainties. This paper aims to provide decision support for investment in sustainable energy projects by evaluating the comparative attractiveness of shifting energy sources from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear. Applying the real options approach (ROA), this paper calculates the value of the flexibility to postpone the investment decision and identifies the optimal timing (described here as the trigger price of coal) for shifting to sustainable energy sources. Then, various uncertainties are considered, such as coal and electricity prices, negative externality of using fossil fuels, and the risk of a nuclear accident, which are modelled using geometric Brownian motion, Poisson process, and Bernoulli probability. Applying the ROA model in the case of the Philippines, results find that investing in sustainable energy is a better option than continuing to use coal for electricity generation. However, contrary to conventional option valuation result that waiting is a better strategy, this study found that delaying or postponing the investment decisions may lead to possible opportunity losses. Among the available sustainable energy sources, geothermal is the most attractive with trigger prices of coal equal to USD 49.95/ton, followed by nuclear (USD 58.55/ton), wind (USD 69.48/ton), solar photovoltaic (USD 72.04/ton), and hydropower (USD 111.14/ton). Also, the occurrence of jump (extreme) prices of coal, raising the current feed-in-tariff, and considering negative externalities can decrease the trigger prices, which favor investments in sustainable energies. Moreover, the risk of a nuclear disaster favors investment in renewable energy sources over nuclear due to the huge damage costs once an accident occurs. Results provide bases for policy recommendations toward achieving a more secure and sustainable energy sector for developing countries that are highly dependent on imported fossil fuels.",dynamic optimization | negative externality | nuclear disaster | nuclear energy | Poisson jump | real options | renewable energy,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

However, this presents a unique challenge for emerging and developing countries. As the technical and financial issues remain a significant barrier in implementing RE projects, several mechanisms are available to aid the financial aspect of investing and implementing clean energy projects. This paper aims to discuss new and traditional trends in the financial area of renewable investment, focusing on the Dominican Republic (DR), identifying the gaps in the financial area regarding RE. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted in the DR. This country is located at the heart of the Caribbean. Given the complexity of RE and developing countries issues and the scarcity of comparable research in the area, an interpretivist research paradigm along with the qualitative methodology was adopted. Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The study sample includes: directors, chief executive officers and managers responsible for the implementation of RE strategies in their respective departments/organisations. NVivo software was used for data management and the collected data was analysed using content analysis. Findings: The research highlighted several severe financial handicaps regarding RE in the DR: The lack of RE assets recognition; lack of RE investment loans; perceived RE risk; and lack of financial guarantor. After extensive interviews with critical actors in the RE sector in the DR, the possible solutions and recommendations for avoiding locking the energy and economic sector in fossil fuel debt are: (a) diversification of RE technology assets recognition, (b) implementation of government RE fund, (c) RE education on all actors and (d) introduction and adoption of new financial trends such as green bonds, bank pooling, cooperatives and more. Originality/value: This paper provides information and knowledge related to financial tools and policies that are available for the RE projects in the DR. The results have a socio-economic impact. This research provides a better understanding of the key financial tools to be explored by RE project developers in the developing countries.

However, environmental priorities should be examined for this situation. Therefore, priority analysis should be executed for the environmental issues while implementing green investment projects. Accordingly, this study aims at proposing a unique decision-making model based on orthopair fuzzy sets and the golden cut degrees for the environmental priorities of green project investments. The main novelty of the study stems from its proposed integrated model by equipping the Multi-SWARA, and TOPSIS based on the q-ROFSs technique with the golden cut. A set of criteria is identified for measuring the green projects' environmental priorities while several project alternatives are also determined with the supporting literature. Appropriately, the extensions of Multi-SWARA and TOPSIS methods have been applied for weighting and ranking the factors, respectively, in the integrated approach. Additionally, a comparative evaluation is performed with the help of VIKOR method to rank the alternatives. Besides, the sensitivity analysis is applied to illustrate the coherency of the weighting results in the decision-making approach. Accordingly, 5 cases are considered to measure the effects of changing weight results. It is defined that this model is coherent and could be extended for further studies. It is concluded that the reduction of emissions is the most essential item for the environmental priorities of green project investments. Pollution control, waste management and eco-friendly transportation activities are the most critical alternatives. Therefore, this study recommends that investors of green projects should prioritize the strategies of minimizing carbon emissions problem. In this context, investing in renewable energy technologies will help green project investors solve this problem.",Environmental priorities | Green project | Q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets | The golden cut,41,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

First, local power describes the authority of local governments to enact regulatory policies in the interests of their citizens. Second, local power describes the authority of local governments to exercise proprietary control over the sources and delivery of electric power to their citizens. This dual meaning of local power is particularly important today, as an increasing number of local governments are seriously considering “municipalizing”-taking control of local electric power systems-at the same time that, outside the electric power sector, many states are constraining local regulatory power by displacing or “preempting” local initiatives in a broad range of environmental, economic, and social policy arenas. Building on this dual meaning of local power, this Article constructs a new and important link between two existing bodies of legal scholarship: (1) state and local government law, with a focus on the recent, aggressive state preemption of local environmental, economic, and social regulatory policies, and (2) energy law, with a focus on the broad authority that exists in virtually every state for local governments to act in a proprietary capacity to control the generation and delivery of electric power to their citizens to meet a broad range of economic, environmental, political, social, and racial equity goals. In establishing this new connection between the two scholarly fields, we illustrate how local communities' exercise of control over electric power systems creates a potential safe harbor from the well-documented trend of increased state preemption of local regulatory authority in many states across the country. This creates opportunities for local governments to use their long-standing proprietary powers to supply electricity to their citizens as a means to meet many of the same economic, environmental protection, and social and racial equity goals they have historically attempted to achieve through traditional regulation. This analysis also provides a new perspective on the renewed scholarly debates over “localism” and shows how local control over power systems can counteract historic parochialism concerns associated with renewable energy projects that are critical to a U.S. clean energy transition.",,2,0,,,USDOE,undefined,U.S. Department of Energy

Using annual panel data for the period 1980–2018, this study applies the second-generation unit root and cointegration tests, panel pooled generalized least square (GLS) estimate, pooled mean group (PMG) estimation, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test to accomplish the study. Westerlund cointegration test confirms a long-run relationship among the variables. The GLS estimation results reveal that FD, ENC, and PCI have significant impacts on environmental pollution. The relationship between FD and CO2 emissions is linear, and thus, FD causes environmental pollution positively; an increasing level of FD does not reduce the latter. PCI and ENC affect environmental quality negatively. However, the existence of the EKC hypothesis is validated, as, at a rising level of PCI, pollution starts declining, taking an inverse U-shape. The PMG estimators also provide similar outcomes and validate the robustness of the panel GLS estimation. The D-H causality test supports the GSL findings and further reveals a feedback relationship between PCI and CO2 emissions, ENC causes CO2 emissions, bidirectional causality exists between FD and ENC, PCI causes both ENC and FD, and CO2 emissions cause FD. The outcomes have implications for the policymakers to encourage firms and stakeholders to invest in renewable energy projects, and the financial intermediaries to the extent and subsidize loans for such investment projects. This is likely to induce investments in renewable energy sources, which will boost the energy portfolios, reduce CO2 emissions, and produce a moderately cleaner environment.","Environmental pollution | Financial development, Energy consumption | Per capita income | South Asia",26,0,,,,undefined,

The physical operating characteristics of synchronous generation inherently contribute to system inertia and fault level contribution to maintain network stability following network disturbances. Inverter or induction generator based non-synchronous generation does not provide these bene ts and, in fact can lead to a reduction in system strength due to their mutual interaction. Therefore, in the transition from fossil fuel to renewable generation, inherent mechanisms to maintain grid stability are being removed. At the same time, generation replacing centralised fossil fuel generation is being developed remote from load centres. This inevitably increases system losses and hence triggers market pricing mechanisms that reward generators that are close to loads and penalise those that are built remote from loads. Finally, the transition to renewable generation, as a result of its intermittent nature, has increased the need for Frequency Control Auxiliary Services (FCAS) to maintain system frequency within prescribed limits. All of these factors are placing a cost impost on VRE generation. These factors have signi cantly increased return on investment volatility, and risk for VRE projects. This has arisen for a number of reasons, such as signi cant falls in Marginal Loss Factors, and increased FCAS charges. The Australian Energy Market Commission, Australian Energy Market Operator, and transmission network system operators have identi ed system strength as a major challenge to the ongoing development and integration of renewable energy projects. System strength is a local phenomenon on the network, with the propagation of system strength limited by the natural impedance of the network. Perceived wisdom is that fault level contribution (to preserve or restore system strength) must be supplied locally within an identi ed weak network. However, this may not be the most ef cient way to maintain system strength when considering the distances to the sources of system strength and the economies of scale of their provision. In the National Electricity Market (NEM), ‘do no harm’ provisions were introduced in December 2017 that place an obligation on generation proponents to ensure that their project does not result in network strength falling below a level that causes system security issues. This may result in the need to install additional capital equipment to meet this obligation, reducing the commercial viability of some projects. The main conclusion of analysis is that a centralised (centrally planned) approach to system strength provision using a few larger synchronous condensers appears to work better for low impedance networks with high levels of redundancy. Whereas a larger number of smaller synchronous condensers appears to work better in networks with high impedance and low interconnectivity under N-1 contingencies. For developers, the best mitigation is to undertake or commission network loss factor projection studies and network system strength and constraint studies early in the project evaluation phase. These factors can potentially be riskier in terms of economic performance of a project than the renewable energy resource (solar or wind) itself.",Marginal Loss Factors | Network losses | Renewable Generation | System Loss Factors | System Strength | Variable Renewable Energy | VRE,0,0,,,,undefined,

However, to date, the renewable energy (RE) sector has attracted only marginal investor interest. This paper aims to identify the challenges faced in financing RE in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of literature in renewable energy finance was conducted and 12 financing challenges were identified. From this list, a questionnaire was developed asking to rank barriers. This was distributed to experts within financial institutions and 32 were returned. A factor analysis and severity index analysis were performed to identify a ranking of challenges impeding RE project financing in Ghana. Findings: The challenges to RE financing fall into the three broad categories, namely, “economic, commercial and regulatory” challenges. Within these broad constraints, “long payback periods,” “limited track record” and “high upfront cost” are the most severe impediments to obtaining financing for RE. Practical implications: Identifying the specific conditions that make an investment in RE unattractive, give policymakers set on achieving the 10% RE goal, a way forward in developing a targeted policy that would mitigate identified investor disincentives. Originality/value: The broad range of potential barriers to investment are known. However, this study combines a specific governmental ambition – encouraging the financing of RE – with a specific set of identified barriers inhibiting that ambition. In this regard, this study identifies exactly where the government needs to act if it is to facilitate investment in RE, as is required for Ghana to reach its 10% RE target.",Economic development | Ghana | Project finance | Renewable energy | sub-Saharan Africa | Sustainability,15,0,,,WBG,undefined,World Bank Group

However, it has a detrimental but insignificant effect on the environment in developing countries. In the case of developed countries, the profound tourism sector is more harmful to the environment due to a large number of tourist arrivals in contrast to the developing countries. There is a wide difference between developed and developing countries concerning industrial, regional, and economic structure, in the effect of financial and tourism development on carbon emission, but both urbanization and primary energy utilization promote carbon emissions. The utilization of renewable energy sources improves the environmental quality in both regions. Generally, it is suggested that investment in renewable energy resources in both regions affects pollution differently and still has the potential to accelerate environmental quality. Moreover, the panel causality test explores that there exists bidirectional causality between financial development, primary energy, and carbon emission in both regions, while a unidirectional causality is observed from urbanization to carbon emission in developed countries.

It further includes, via the Monte Carlo method, a probabilistic underpinning to the project. The hydro-economic model was applied to a tidal energy project using an Evopod 1:4th scale prototype, based on a real deployment of an Evopod 1:10th scale device in the Ria Formosa, Algarve. The results show that, under the current costs and benefits, the project is not economically viable. However, there are admissible parameter ranges that make the project viable such as significant reduction of investment costs, increased capacity factors and favourable energy prices. This novel methodology has potential to be applied to other tidal energy projects on estuarine systems worldwide, and consists of a comprehensive modelling approach, including the technical, environmental, and socio-economic dimensions of the project, not only in a deterministic setting but also in a probabilistic one.",Cost-benefit analysis | Hydro-economic model | Monte Carlo method | Tidal energy production,8,0,,,H2020,067/2018,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

This article begins by investigating the GHG emissions for the manufacturing of two stationary lithium-ion batteries, comparing production in Europe, US and China. Next, we analyze how the installation and operation of these batteries change the GHG emissions of the electricity supply in two pilot sites. Life cycle assessment is used for GHG emissions calculation. The regional comparison on GHG emissions of battery manufacturing shows that primary aluminum, cathode paste and battery cell production are the principal components of the GHG emissions of battery manufacturing. Regional variations are linked mainly to high grid electricity demand and regional changes in the electricity mixes, resulting in base values of 77 kg CO2-eq/kWh to 153 kg CO2-eq/kWh battery capacity. The assessment of two pilot sites shows that the implementation of batteries can lead to GHG emission savings of up to 77%, if their operation enables an increase in renewable energy sources in the electricity system.",Batteries | Energy storage | Life cycle assessment | Renewable energy,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,H2020,646426,Klima- und Energiefonds

However, it is unclear whether communication requirements and willingness to protest are connected and to which extent communication strategies help to create and shape a dialogue between potential protesters and other stakeholders. A conjoint approach was chosen to determine relationships between communication and protest motivation in the energy context. We compare this with mobility infrastructure and local political projects as examples, to find out whether results are unique or generalizable. Overall, we found generalizable aspects, that are the same for the energy and the example contexts. Point in time, informing person and participation were relevant decision criteria, whereas information channel was the least important independent communication criterion for all contexts.

Three types of small wind turbines are studied to select suitable wind turbines for each site based on the capacity factor concept. HOMER simulation software is used to design and determine the feasibility of the systems. The optimal configuration is obtained at each site of the country in terms of the lowest net present cost and CO2 emissions using the Wes-tulipo wind turbine. The obtained results show that wind energy is suitable for most cities. It is even more profitable and competitive than photovoltaic (PV) in northern and central Tunisia. In contrast, the PV system has great potential for development in the southern regions of the country. The economic benefit of the renewable energy project for each site is between 11 and 16 years during the 25-years project lifetime, proving its economic attractiveness.

In studying the processes of the small energy development, it is important to detail regional features and economic conditions that determine competitiveness of promising types of energy sources. The article presents the analysis results of the DES of the Russia northern territories on the example of three regions: the Republic of Komi, the Arkhangelsk region, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The analysis aim is to determine the existing prerequisites and barriers to active development of the small power generation in the North. On the basis of the detailed energy-economic indicators and the received generalizations, options for improving the efficiency of autonomous energy supply based on conventional and new small-sized power generation technologies are being considered. The analysis showed that the development of DES zones does not have the institutional incentives and sufficient resource base for qualitative technological modernization. Most of the investment and operating costs of DES in the northern regions are compensated through cross- and budget subsidizations. Traditional diesel generation remains high-cost and low-efficiency, its modernization is carried out at slow rate, the potential of electric and heat energy cogeneration is not used. Renewable energy technologies are not ready for large implementation in local energy systems of the North and Arctic of Russia. The renewables projects, implemented over the past five years, are mainly experimental and demonstration. The analysis of the indicators of the ""northern"" renewable energy projects does not confirm their economic efficiency. The reasons are not only in the high unit investment costs, but also in relatively low utilization rates of the installed capacity (capacity factors) of solar and wind power plants.

The purpose of this work is to study the effectiveness of the development of the Russian energy sector and its contribution to the world economy. The main question to which this article should give an answer is that how the Russian power industry will develop in corresponding to the global trends in energy consumption. This paper uses a method for finding the parameters of the efficiency of renewable energy sources using exponential smoothing. The paper uses data from the analytical report of British Petroleum and the Bloomberg system for the period from January 2012 to December 2019. The result of the study shows an improvement in the accuracy of the predicted values, while previous models had higher standard error estimates. The novelty of the study is to achieve accurate results of the forecast of fossil-fuel consumption for 3 years ahead (the forecast accuracy is 80.5). The article concludes that while Russian oil and gas projects are very important for the Russian economy until now, renewable energy projects are more beneficial. In addition, Russia does not seem to support the global trend towards a renewable and sustainable economy. Although oil and gas prices remain acceptable, unforeseen changes in the behavior of real buyers can hinder the efficiency of the Russian economy and lead to a disruption of Russia's economic growth if Russia does not decisively steer towards renewable energy from now on. The growth of the Russian power industry corresponds to the global trends in fossil energy consumption (while fossil prices, thus incomes keep worsening), and thus innovative solutions for enhancing renewable energies must be adopted. The article proves that many pipeline projects (South Stream, Turkish Stream, Nord Stream 2) move the Russian energy sector back to the past because they just contradict existing trends.",Electrical grids | Energy resources | Hydropower | Natural gas | Power consumption | Stock quotes movement,39,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,HUFS,undefined,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies

The increased pollution levels across the globe combined with the rapid depletion of these carbon-based non-renewable sources of energy has forced nations to adopt cleaner sources such as solar energy, wind energy, biomass etc. for meeting energy requirements. Utilities and power transmission companies, in several countries, have begun installation and operation of large-scale solar energy projects in order to augment the present electricity generation capacity. India has a tremendous potential for solar energy as 58% of the total land area receives an average solar insolation above 5 kWh/m2/day, annually. However, PV installations require proper economic formulation and technical modelling of PV plants. The study presented in this paper investigates the feasibility of installing a 1 MW grid-connected PV system in the arid climatic conditions of India. Four different regions of the Thar Desert: Barmer, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Kalan Ghat have been considered for the study. A comparative study has been laid out based on energy yields, losses, and degradation of various module technologies namely mono-Si, poly-Si, CdTe, and CIS. The performance of the PV systems has been evaluated both in the fixed-tilt and variable-tilt configurations. Simulation results show that the daily yield in winter months ranges between 5.8 and 6.9 MWh/day whereas, during summer, it ranges between 5 and 7.1 MWh/day. The study suggests that CIS module is expected to produce highest annual energy yield of 2471 MWh with a PR of 86.1%, in the variable-tilt configuration for the Jaisalmer region. Annual energy loss due to temperature is expected to be highest for mono-Si technology (14.4%) in the variable-tilt configuration and lowest for CIS technology (9.4%) in the fixed-tilt configuation. Moreover, mismatch losses for all the four technologies lie in the range of 0.1-1.1%.",arid zone | CdTe | CIS | degradation | energy loss | mono-Si | performance | performance ratio | photovoltaics | poly-Si | solar,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

In the most part, solar and wind energy options are chosen as renewable energy projects to meet part of electricity demand. However, because of the intermittent nature of these sources, alternative technologies should be chosen to provide effective and sustainable solutions. Various energy resources need to be combined in order to provide effective and efficient power generation. The present paper therefore focuses on the feasibility study of integrated energy systems for the energy supply of the educational institution. The work examines the techno-economic performance of various grid-connected and stand-alone integrated energy systems for an educational institute for making a decision before implementing green energy technologies. First, the energy demand is estimated for the entire campus. Further, the potential of renewable energy resources is assessed using NASA and NREL. A detailed survey was carried out to select the components required to model the various integrated energy systems. The modelling, optimization and economic study are performed using HOMER Pro software. A comparative economic analysis is made among considered integrated systems using Net Present Cost (NPC), COE and pay-back period. The study divulges that the grid-connected hybrid system is the optimal one for meeting the power demand of the institute in a reliable manner.","Diesel generators, HOMER Pro | Integrated energy system | Solar/ Wind energy",23,0,,,,undefined,

A simple Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) method was used in selecting the three (3) representative renewable energy (RE) businesses based on registered energy projects by the Energy Commission (EC) of Ghana. The analysis compared the 3 business sites with regard to generating power: (1) feeding to the national grid (FiT) (2) for self-consumption (prosumers) and (3) for agricultural use (through irrigation). The result showed that hybridization of solar and waste to energy systems is feasible with the use of manual change over for small and non-critical applications and smart energy control systems for community based and critical applications. It also revealed that integrating solar PV system with an existing biogas plant is both feasible in terms of technical and cost-effective wise to boost the power production for daily usage. However, the hybrid power system would be viable at an operational cost of 40% revenue and at a FiT unit price of $0.17/kWh. Further, the study found that adding a biogas plant to an existing solar PV plant would be more expensive. In all, solar–biogas hybrid power system has a great future through its operational flexibility of mitigating potential shortfall in power, both seasonally and diurnally, and assuring a more secure and efficient supply of energy for communities both grid and non-grid connected. The use of energy from renewable sources, by its efficiency and reduction of carbon footprints, will contribute to the attainment of the core objectives of some key global protection and socio-economic development initiatives/programs including Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - namely SDGs 7,13.",Hybrid power system | Hybrid solar–biogas system | Multi criteria analysis | Renewable energy | Sustainable development goals,22,0,,,BMBF,undefined,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung

We address this gap in a study conducted in Guernsey, Channel Islands. Data was collected using a survey (n = 468) co-designed with island policy makers presenting technical, economic and locational details of a potential offshore wind project. Results show that acceptance of the same project design differed significantly across alternative development locations. Regression analyses compared the roles of personal, context and project-related factors in explaining acceptance for each site. Support for using wind energy for local electricity supply was the most important predictor of acceptance, and this variable mediated the relationship between island energy security and community acceptance. We conclude that place matters for community acceptance and that security and autonomy are co-benefits of local renewable energy projects that deserve further research.",Autonomy | Community acceptance | Place | Security | Wind energy,67,0,repositoryam,Green,ESRC,undefined,Economic and Social Research Council

Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) provides developing countries with results-based financial incentives for reducing deforestation and forest degradation through either non-market payments (payments without generation of carbon credits), or market-based mechanisms (carbon credits). REDD credits have been recently accepted to be used in offsetting programs (e.g., CORSIA) and are being considered under Article 6. However, various publications have questioned whether carbon credits from REDD should be accepted under market-based mechanisms, and have identified issues regarding their environmental integrity and their ability to offset emissions from other sectors. In recent years, REDD implementation has moved from the project level to the national or subnational (jurisdictional) level, and is addressing some of the concerns that have been raised for project-level interventions regarding the robustness of baselines and leakage, for example. In this paper we compare the environmental integrity of credits from REDD programs with that from on-grid renewable energy projects by examining aspects related to permanence, additionality, baselines, uncertainty, and leakage. We show that the environmental integrity of emission reductions sourced from REDD programs has unique strengths, and that those sourced from renewable energy projects have weaknesses of their own. Probably due to a lack of understanding of the respective weaknesses and strengths of these two sources of credits, the emission reductions from REDD programs have been historically questioned and subjected to a level of scrutiny that has not been made with emission reductions from other sectors, such as renewable energy projects. Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of emission reductions from both types should help decision makers and carbon standards recognize the high quality of emission reductions from REDD programs, and rationalize the current requirements or restrictions imposed.",Additionality | Baseline | Carbon credits | Environmental integrity | Forest emissions | Leakage | Permanence | REDD | REDD Program | REDD+ | Renewable energy project | Reversals | Uncertainty,13,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

In Brazil, micro and small companies contribute about 25% of gross domestic product (GDP), and electric energy is employed intensively, so the importance of microgeneration is observable. This research aims to analyze the economic viability of the micro-generation wind energy project for micro and small businesses. Thus, three Brazilian states, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais were considered, and different scenarios were proposed. A feasibility analysis is then performed, followed by a stochastic analysis using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Finally, models of artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to evaluate the relative importance (RI) of the variables. The results show that none of the states appears economically feasible under the conditions presented. In the stochastic analysis, the probability of viability is between 17% and 24% in all states, which shows the low probability of viability for microgeneration. Through ANN training, it was possible to calculate the RI, in which it is possible to identify the variables that have most impact on the net present value (NPV) in all states; it is considered the most important variable in the project's viability. In addition, the discussion explores the importance of public incentives for promoting investment in renewable energy, which can reduce investment costs and make it attractive to small and medium-sized businesses.",artificial neural networks | Microgeneration | sensitivity analysis | stochastic feasibility analysis | wind power,12,1,repositoryam,Green,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

Environmental problems caused by industrial wastes have been becoming serious issues in developing countries. Hence, recycling industrial wastes, in order to create more renewable and clean energy, has been recognized as one of ways to reduce adverse impact of global warming and negative effect of greenhouse gases. According to statistics, Viet Nam discharges about 400,000 tons of waste tires annually and this number in the US is estimated about 4,200,000 tons per year (source: vnu.edu.vn). This creates many environmental issues. Hence, this paper aims to propose a business model to solve problems mentioned below in the paper. Building a tire shredding plant in California, USA (for example) to cut the whole tires into small shredded tires then export to developing countries like Vietnam is one method to convert wastes into clean energy and protecting our environment.

The study adopts a robust version of two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) on a panel of twenty-five upper-middle and lower-middle income economies for the period 1990 to 2015. The results show that the use of renewable energy helps in the control of carbon emissions, while the consumption of non-renewable energy contributes to the increase of carbon emissions in the developing Asian economies. Moreover, the results confirm inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita economic growth and carbon emissions in this region. Empirical results further depict that in developing countries, depletion of natural resources and growing population pressures are both contributing factors to carbon emissions. The findings spotlight that a transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources is indispensable if Asian developing countries are to control carbon emissions and foster carbon-free economic growth.
